### 8.3.4. The Sources Thesis

On Raz’s view, it is necessary for the existence of a legal system that there are
criteria of validity of legal norms that are practiced by law-applying officials,
but he rejected Hart’s core idea that the criteria validity are determined exclu-
sively by the contingent practice of those officials (Raz 1980, 198–200). Raz
held, rather, that it is a conceptual matter—a matter about our concept of law,
not merely an empirical matter—what can count as criteria of validity: A fun-
damental fact about what is and is not law is that law is strictly a matter of
social fact (Raz 1979, 37–40). (Within these parameters, official practice can
determine, e.g., whether custom or decrees of the monarch are sources of law.)
This led Raz to his most important jurisprudential thesis, which he calls the
Sources Thesis (ST): All law is source-based, that is, all laws are such that their
existence and content can be identified by reference to social facts alone, with-
out resort to any evaluative argument. This “parsimonious” thesis holds that
“there is nothing more to law than source-based law” (Raz 1995a, 211).
Let us take note of several features of ST. First, along with the positivist
tradition at least since Bentham, ST assumes silently that necessary features of
law are always features of individual laws (or discrete relations among them).
“Law” in positivist usage always refers to the aggregate of legal norms. Thus,
law is source-based just because all laws are source-based. Second, the social
facts countenanced by ST are facts about the origins or provenance of legal
norms; specifically, they are facts about the actions of institutions that authori-
tatively lay down or endorse those norms (Raz 1996b, 14–5). Thus, all laws
are said to be source-based: their existence—their status as valid legal norms—
and their normative content—the actions they require, permit, authorize, or
prohibit—are exclusively determined by appeal to their sources. No evalua-
tive considerations are needed to determine the existence and content of legal
norms. ST rules out moral considerations as potential criteria of validity in any
legal system. Thus, if ST is true as a general jurisprudential matter, then, pace
Hart, no legal system includes moral principles among its criteria of validity.
Third, the sources are the sole basis for identifying the existence and content
of legal norms (Raz 1979, 38–41). Sources alone provide the epistemic basis for
distinguishing between norms that belong to a legal system and those that do
not. This might seem to leave open the possibility that their status as laws is
grounded ontologically on some other property (Coleman 1996, 307–8). How-
ever, it is clear that Raz understood “identifying” the existence of a legal norm
to leave no logical space between the epistemic and the ontological determina-
tion of legal validity (see below sec. 8.5.2.1). The law, he wrote, “derives exclu-
sively from, or is dependent exclusively on,” sources (Raz 1995a, 332).
CLT and ST supply the foundation of Raz’s theory of law. Some critics have
found this combination paradoxical, one doctrine moving decidedly in a natu-
ral-law direction and the other in a resolutely positivist one. Indeed, some crit-
ics have argued that CLT undermines ST (Goldsworthy 1990, 486). However,
Raz maintained that the two theses are not only consistent, but that CLT pro-
vides the major premise of the strongest argument for ST. The two theses are
locked together in a close theoretical partnership. Let us look at this argument.

## 8.4. The Case for the Sources Thesis

A number of arguments for ST are sprinkled throughout Raz’s writings, some
of which are perhaps more suggestive than persuasive (Raz 1979, chap. 3;
1980, 213–6; 1995a, 206–7, 220). The most important and the most detailed
of his arguments proceeds from his thesis that law necessarily claims legitimate
authority. We begin with a sketch of the argument and then in sub-section 4.2
look closely at its most important premise.

8.4.1. Authority Requires Sources
Raz’s argument falls into two parts.[^10] The first part begins with CLT (necessar-
ily, law claims legitimate authority) and unfolds the notion of authority at its
center. Law claims authority, so the argument goes, just insofar as laws are tak-
en to be the directives of persons who claim to have authority. To claim author-
ity (whether truly or falsely) is to claim that the directives issued by the author-
ities should be followed by those subject to them without regard to the practi-
cal merits of the actions and the reasons on which the directives are based,
because in doing so they are more likely to do what they are supposed to do
(as determined by reasons independent of the law’s requiring it) than if they
were to act on their own assessment of the relevant reasons. Thus, in claiming
authority, law claims to mediate between the reasons law-subjects have to act
and the actions to which those reasons direct them. Law settles for them how
best to act. The point of according authority to law, it is argued, is to enable
law-subjects to act in accord with the reasons they have without having to base
their actions on their own estimation of what those reasons direct them to do.
The second part of the argument for ST unpacks implications of the con-
ception of law as mediator. The law’s claim to authority is not always true, of
course, but if it is essential to the nature of law that it makes such a claim, then,
Raz argued, certain things follow about what must necessarily be true about
law. To begin, law must be at least capable of having the authority it claims.
Something can fail to have the authority it claims if it fails to meet the moral or
normative conditions of having authority—if there are not sufficient reasons
to hold the claim to be true or warranted—but something cannot even intel-
ligibly claim to have authority if it lacks certain non-normative conditions of
having authority. Raz called attention to two critical non-normative conditions
of having authority: (a) it must be possible to recognize the alleged authorita-
tive directives as someone’s view of how subjects ought to act, and (b) it must
be possible to identify the directives as being issued by the alleged authority
(and grasp the content of the directives) without engaging in deliberation on
matters which the directive purports to settle.
These two conditions make sense, Raz argued, if we keep in mind author-
ity’s mediating role. First, since the point of acknowledging authority is to put
another practical reasoner in one’s own place and to take the results of his de-
liberation for one’s own when it comes to action, a directive can claim to be
authoritative only if it can be presented as someone’s view about how those to
be guided by the directive ought to act. If practical directives cannot be pre-
sented in this way, they fail as authoritative directives, not because they give
bad instruction, but rather because they give the wrong kind of instruction
(Raz 1995a, 219). Second, the point of acknowledging authority—to enable us
better to conform to the requirements of reason without having to make our
own estimates of what those requirements are—would be defeated if we had to
figure out what we are supposed to do in order to determine what the author-
ity requires of us. Subjects can reap the benefits that authoritative directives
offer only if they can identify them and what they require without addressing
the same practical issues the authority is there to settle (ibid.). Authoritative
directives, then, must be identified on the basis of considerations that are not
tied to the merits of the actions required by them, but rather on facts about
who issued them and the norm they sought thereby to establish.

[^10]: This argument is adumbrated in Raz 1979, 50–1 and 1980, 64–5 and elaborated in 1995a,
chap. 10, which drew on 1986b, chaps. 2–4. See also Raz 1989, 1179–94, 1201–12 and a brief
summary in 1996b, 18. He set this argument in a larger context of moral reasoning in Raz 2004.
My sketch in this section follows 1995a, chap. 10. In Chapter 10, sec. 1.4, below we will consider
his discussion in Raz 2004. A complete view of Raz’s argument must combine both of these
sources.

Thus, since law necessarily claims authority and so must at least possess the
capacity to have authority, laws must be seen to be the expression of the views
of legal authorities about how best to act and they should be identifiable with-
out recourse to what the law is meant to settle, that is, without recourse to the
reasons on which the law is based. If these conditions were not met, law’s claim
to authority would not merely be false, it would not be intelligible, Raz argued.
So, the existence and content of laws can be based only on non-evaluative con-
siderations of a specific kind, namely, facts about their sources in the acts and
intentions of authorities who establish or posit them. Laws must not only be
authoritative, on this view, they must also be authoritatively posited. Because
laws are rooted in legislation, judicial decisions, and custom, they are source-
based and hence capable of being authoritative directives, i.e., capable of play-
ing the mediating role that is characteristic of practical authority. In sum, since,
necessarily, law claims authority, it follows that all laws must be source-based,
such that their existence and content is determined strictly by reference to so-
cial facts about their authoritative sources.
This argument makes good on the promise to tie in a tight theoretical knot
the two focal theses of exclusive positivism: the claimed legitimacy thesis and
the sources thesis. If it is sound, it shows that principles or standards that are
not source-based—for example, principles of justice, fairness, or other dimen-
sions of morality—cannot qualify as authoritative directives, and hence as laws,
and any theory that insists on including them as constituents of a legal system
cannot make sense of the existence of legal authorities (Raz 1995a, 299–300).
Moral principles fail both tests of capacity for authority. They are not the prod-
ucts of anyone’s judgment, but rather are valid just insofar as there are sound
and convincing arguments for them. They cannot be presented as any person’s
view of what people should do. Thus, they fail the first condition. Also, since
moral principles can be identified only by recourse to the reasons on which
they are grounded—by their nature moral principles are not “pedigreed”—
they fail the second condition. Necessarily, moral principles are extra-legal,
never to be counted among the propositions of law (Raz 1995a, 224–5). Thus,
jurisprudential theories like Dworkin’s “law as integrity” (Dworkin 1986; see
below chap. 9, sec. 9.4) as well as the Hart’s inclusive positivism, are inconsist-
ent with the authoritative nature of law.
This powerful critique of rival legal theories depends entirely on the sound-
ness of the above argument for ST. The full weight of that argument rests on
premises in the first part of it—the claimed legitimacy thesis and especially the
conception of authority it is thought to bring to bear on the analysis of the na-
ture of law. We will explore this conception in the next section, but we might
pause briefly to mention briefly three questions about other parts of the argu-
ment that suggest themselves. First, Raz assumed that the normative conditions
are conditions of the truth of an alleged authority’s claim, but that the condi-
tions of the claim’s intelligibility will be exclusively non-normative. However,
one might wonder about this division of labor. Might there not also be a cred-
ibility condition on the intelligibility of the claim, such that a claim of authority
would fail for not being the kind of thing that could be good at doing what we
expect those with authority to do? Consider an analogy. A physician’s medi-
cal license is no guarantee that she is competent, but the claim of competence
of an unlicensed person ordinarily will not be minimally credible. The same
seems true of practical authorities. Since the point of recognizing a practical
authority is that we are more likely to do what we are supposed to do accord-
ing to reasons that apply to us by following authoritative directives than by act-
ing on our own assessment of those reasons, it would seem natural to insist on
a threshold of competence with respect to that task. What that license would
look like and at what level the threshold of credibility would be set are matters
that are likely to turn on evaluative considerations. Raz (1986b, 47) says that
we are likely to be skeptical of any claims that law or political authorities might
make to expertise, but he says that creates no problem for his argument, since
his argument depends on the intelligibility of the claim of authority, not on its
truth or even plausibility. However, if we grant the need for a credibility condi-
tion, we must admit that there may be reasons for skepticism profound enough
to challenge not just the truth of the claim to authority but even its intelligi-
bility. (This worry relates to a concern we raise later about the plausibility of
CLT as a universal and necessary interpretive thesis about law, see sec. 8.5.2.1,
below.)
Second, Raz’s argument rests on the strong premise that a directive can be
authoritative only if it is someone’s directive. It is not clear why this personal-
ism is necessary for the authority of directives. Why, for example, could not a
rule rest on wisdom accumulated within a community over time, even though
it is not the wisdom of any particular person? Why, Fuller might ask, could not
rules that emerge from social interaction and serve adequately to solve prob-
lems of cooperation, carry the appropriate authority? Raz seems to have as-
sumed that the directives must be posited, but this only raises the same question again: Why must they be (in order to serve the purpose of authoritative
directives)? Perhaps, the reason is that any attempt to formulate the rule of
community practice would inevitably involve appeal to considerations the di-
rectives are “meant to settle.”
Third, this response makes clear an even more serious question: Can Raz’s
account of law’s authority explain the presence and functioning of custom as a
source of law. Raz often acknowledged custom as a source of law, but custom-
ary rules do not meet the conditions of authority. They typically are not prod-
ucts of anyone’s judgment of reasons that apply to law-subjects. Raz (1996a,
1)   himself once wondered whether his account of law fits customary law and
whether case law established by the courts should be understood on the model
of customary law, but these doubts did not cause him to make any adjustments
in his theory of law. Fuller, we might expect, would have wondered why.

8.4.2. The Service Conception of Authority
Putting these questions aside, let us turn now to the pivot of Raz’s argument
for ST, his theory of authority.[^11] This theory has two components: (a) a formal
analysis of the concept of authority and the kind of reasons those who claim
authority purport to offer their subjects, and (b) a substantive account of the
kind of arguments that would be sufficient to ground a claim of legitimate
moral authority. Consider first the formal part.

[^11]: For discussions of authority see Raz 1979, chaps. 1–2; 1980, 38–43, 62–5, 191–5; 1986b,
chaps.2–4; 1989, 1179–200; 1990a; 1995a, 210–5, 341–60; and 2003, 259–64. Shapiro (2002a)
offers a useful discussion of Raz’s theory of authority in the context of contemporary debates
about the nature of authority, including a helpful summary of major criticisms of the theory.

8.4.2.1. Authority and Exclusionary Reasons
To understand the authority claimed by law, we need to consider practical au-
thority in general. When we speak of something or someone as having author-
ity we can have a number of different things in mind. Sometimes we mean only
that some form of guidance can be trusted or is binding; however, when using
it in what Raz took to be its central meaning we suggest something more robust:
that something is made binding by an authority. It is this “central meaning” that
Raz (1990a, 2; 2003, 259) sought to capture. It has several key features.
First, and most importantly, since authority is a practical concept, state-
ments about who has authority or what an authority requires figure as premises
in practical inferences. Thus, to explain the concept of authority it is necessary
to explain its practical import (Raz 1979, 10). To locate conditions of intel-
ligibility of authority claims, we need to inquire into the practical point of ac-
knowledging law’s authority. A corollary of this is that the notion of legitimate
or de jure authority is primary, and the notion of de facto authority must be
explained in terms of it (Raz 1979, 9–11; 1986b, 27). So the first salient feature
of authority is that it is at bottom normative. Moreover, the practical point of
authority is a morally significant one, and statements about it are contestable
on moral grounds, Raz recognized, precisely because the stakes are moral.
The second salient feature of authority is that it is at bottom personal in
the sense that it is attributed first of all to persons or agents (or institutions
personified) and derivatively to other things. We can speak of rules, norms,
commands, or directives having authority—or being authoritative—but their
authority derives from the persons or parties that issue, establish, or endorse
them. This is the implicit starting point of his analysis; it is clear from his infor-
mal statement of the “central meaning” of authority. Authority is understood,
first of all, in terms of certain properties of authorities, that is, persons having
authority or in positions of authority (Raz 1979, 21; 1986b, 24; 1990a, 2; 1995a,
211; 2003, 259). In sum, there is no authoritative directive without practical
authority, and no practical authority without an author (Marmor 2001b, 54,
89–111). Third, authority is at bottom a relational matter. Someone has author-
ity just in case, with respect to some practical matter, that party has authority
over some agent (Raz 1979, 21). (If one has authority over oneself, one has
autonomy.) In fact, authority is a kind of power one agent can exercise over
another. This leads us to the fourth key point: the power in question is norma-
tive power: the power to change another agent’s reasons to act (Raz 1979, 16–20;
2003, 259).[^12] Authority is the power to create a special kind of reason which
Raz called a “protected reason.” A protected reason is a reason for an agent
to act in a certain way without regard to other reasons for and against doing
so (Raz 1979, 17–18). It preempts other reasons. Obligations are, according
to Raz, a kind of protected reason; so a corollary of this fourth point is that
authority is at bottom the power to impose obligations on another agent (Raz
1986b, 27–8; 1989, 1186). Finally, someone has de jure, i.e., justified authority
over another agent just in case the former has the right to exercise this power
to impose obligations on the other (Raz 1989, 1186). Authority is, we might
say, the right to rule.

[^12]: Coercive power plays no essential role in Raz’s analysis of authority. Coercive power plays
only the secondary or derivative role of making effective the imposition of authority-created
obligations. Authority as understood by Raz always entails a kind of inequality or asymmetry;
however, it is inequality not of physical power, but of normative status, a matter of dominion and
subordination of wills rather than physical domination.


A person is entitled to authority over another just when it is reasonable for
the latter to recognize the other’s authority and treat that person’s directives
as protected reasons for action.[^13] To accord another person authority is not to
adopt a certain attitude, but rather to treat authority’s directives a certain way
in one’s practical reasoning. To explain authority is to explain the role of its
directives in practical reasoning and the reasons there might be, if any, for a
rational agent to give them that role. Thus, Raz’s task of making authority in-
telligible involves making authority-reasons intelligible by explaining their role
in practical reasoning. For this we must make a short excursion into the theory
of practical reasoning.

[^13]: A person has authority (de jure) over someone if that person is recognized as an authority
(has de facto authority) and this recognition is justified (the person is entitled to it), see 1986b, 56 and sec. 8.2.2.2, below.

The theory of practical reasoning explores the nature and limits of rational-
ity in action. Practical rationality, according to Raz (1999, 71), is a matter of
an agent’s being responsive to reasons. A rational agent can be appropriately
responsive to reasons in different ways. Reason guides the actions of rational
agents by providing reasons for (and against) actions. But an agent fulfills the
demands of reasons if her action conforms to them; it is not necessary that the
agent follow or comply with (“act from,” Kant would say) those reasons, except
in special cases (Raz 1990b, 178–82). Raz rejected what Gardner and Macklem
(2002, 461) call the “rationalist myth” that reasons are for following, that is,
“that there can be no better way of doing what any reason would have one do
than by acting for that reason”. Moreover, the topography of practical reason-
ing is stratified (Raz 1990b, 190). Some of our reasons are second-order rea-
sons—reasons to act or not to act for certain other reasons (ibid., 39). The idea
is more familiar than it might at first seem. Consider the relationship between
lovers. The relationship is healthy when the lover gives a gift to the beloved for
the reason that it brings her pleasure. The lover, knowing the gift will please the
beloved, has a reason to buy-the-gift-because-she-will-be-thrilled. Raz’s analy-
sis of authority draws on a different kind of second-order reason: preemptive
or exclusionary reasons (we can use these terms interchangeably). Preemptive
reasons are negative second-order reasons, that is, reasons not to act for certain
other reasons (ibid., 39ff.).
Exclusionary reasons in a sense defeat other reasons for action, but the
way they defeat excluded reasons is unique. To see this, consider some ways
in which reasons can be defeated. Some, for example, are defeated by being
outweighed. It is common to imagine that reasons for action have a kind of
normative “weight” that is additive such that when they conflict with other
reasons, deliberation determines what is best to do in light of these reasons
by determining what action the sum of these weights (the balance of reasons)
most favors. Reasons against an action favored by the balance of reasons are
defeated by being outweighed. They remain valid, of course, and have con-
tinuing normative force (often requiring mitigation or compensation for the
unfortunate consequences of the action favored by the balance of reasons).
Some reasons are defeated by being canceled (Raz 1978, 12–3). In certain cir-
cumstances, or faced with opposition by certain other kinds of reasons, reasons
that normally are valid lose their normative force; e.g., a promise is normally a
good reason to do what is promised, unless it is a promise to murder. Some
reasons come into play only under certain conditions and if those conditions
are not met, the alleged reason has no normative force. Some reasons, that is,
have certain normative limits or conditions and when these limits have been
passed or the conditions are not met, they are not overpowered by conflicting
reasons, they are simply canceled.
Excluded reasons are neither outweighed nor canceled. They are defeated
by being preempted, excluded as grounds for acting in certain ways. Thus, for
example, the military officer’s order is a reason for the private to do as ordered,
and not to treat the inconvenience of his doing so, or the likelihood of failure,
as reasons against doing so. Excluded reasons are not canceled, Raz argued;
they remain valid but are rendered inoperative at the point of deciding what
to do (Raz 1990b, 183–4; 1989, 1158). This fact, that the normative validity
of excluded reasons is not adversely affected by their being preempted, is es-
sential to the normative force of preemptive reasons. For the normative point
of preemptive reasons is to enable rational agents to conform better to the
reasons that apply to them, including especially the reasons thereby excluded.
Excluded reasons are not overridden, neither are preemptive reasons merely
indicators of the relative weight of the underlying excluded reasons (Raz 1979,
22–3; 1990b, 37–45, 189–90; 1989, 1165–8). Reasons are excluded by kind, not
by their weight (Raz 1979, 24); they are removed from the set of reasons that a
rational agent balances on the way to deciding what is to be done. We deploy
preemptive reasons in our practical reasoning in order to avoid the need to
assess the relative weight of certain competing first-order reasons (Raz 1990b,
190). Preemptive reasons do not stand in the way of an agent’s deliberation
about the implications of excluded reasons for action, but rather they disen-
gage that deliberation from the agent’s immediate decision to act. Preemptive
reasons, we might say, permit off-line deliberation but prohibit online delibera-
tion. Moreover, they disengage the agent’s deliberation only with respect to the
reasons that fall within the scope of the exclusion. Preemptive reasons compete
in the ordinary way with all reasons that do not fall within that scope.
Raz (1990b, 37–9) sought to demonstrate that preemptive reasons are fa-
miliar to ordinary practical reasoning by offering a number of examples; how-
ever, many of them, with the exception of his military example, failed to per-
suade readers (see, for example, Shapiro 2002a, 403–13). His most persuasive
argument for the existence of preemptive reasons was a rational-functional ar-
gument. Preemptive reasons play an important role in ordinary practical rea-
soning, he argued, because they provide resources for more effective rational
action. Preemptive reasons represent a strategy of indirection (Raz 1990b,
190,193). The value of preemptive reasons lies in the recognition that one can
improve one’s chances of acting on the balance of reasons by not balancing
those reasons oneself.
Exclusionary reasons have a two-fold dimension of scope that is determined
by the reasons on which the preemption is grounded. Exclusionary reasons may
be limited with respect to their substance (substance-scope): their underlying
justification may call for the exclusion of only a certain range of reasons that an
agent might have. Exclusionary reasons may also be limited with respect to the
subjects who are justified in relying on them (subject-scope), because capaci-
ties for effective action-oriented deliberating on that range of reasons may vary
among rational agents. There may also be certain external limits on the appro-
priateness of deploying exclusionary reasons, for example, there may be kinds
of reasons, or occasions for relying on them, that may never be excluded from
an agent’s deliberation. For example, moral autonomy, according to Raz (1979,
57; 1989, 1180), may require that agents always keep in mind a certain range of
moral considerations. We might call this the “autonomy proviso.”
The notion of preemptive reasons lies at the heart of Raz’s account of au-
thority. Authoritative directives claim to provide preemptive reasons for action
to those who are subject to them. Our explication of the notion of preemptive
reasons and their role in practical reasoning completes one half of our task of
making the notion of authority practically intelligible. It also puts us on the
path to fulfilling the second half of that task, which is to identify the kind of
arguments that might be sufficient to justify our according authority to certain
persons and the directives they issue.

8.4.2.2. The Justification of Authority
In his classic discussion of the authority of law in De Cive, Hobbes highlighted
the distinguishing features of law’s authority by contrasting advice and counsel
with law’s commands. Advice, he wrote,

> is an instruction or precept (praeceptum) in which the reason for following it is drawn from the matter itself. But a command is an instruction in which the reason for following it is drawn from the will of the instructor [...]. But since laws are obeyed not for their content, but because of the will of the instructor, law is not advice but command, and is defined thus: law is a command of that person [...] whose instruction is the reason for obedience. (Hobbes 1998, 153–4, emphasis removed)

Not only does the reason for obeying lie not in the content of the command
but in the commanding (it is, as we now way, “content-independent”), but also
“will stands for reason”—the commanding is meant to be taken as preemptive.
Hobbes grounded these two defining features of law in three deeper features
of law’s authority. First, “law comes from one who has power over those whom
he instructs” (inequality of status); second, law imposes duties, unlike advice
which leaves actions up to an agent’s discretion; and third, while “advice is di-
rected to the purpose of the person instructed, law [is directed to] to the pur-
pose of the instructor” (Hobbes 1998, 154, original emphasis).[^14] This last feature accounts for the fact that commands impose duties whereas the directives
of counsel leave compliance up to the discretion of the person counseled (see
Hobbes 1991, 176).


[^14]: In Leviathan, Hobbes tied the commander’s purpose to his own interest or benefit. From
the principle that “the proper object of every mans Will, is some Good to himselfe,” he inferred that “he that Commandeth, pretendeth thereby his own Benefit,” concluding that “between
Counsel and Command, one great difference is, that Command is directed to a mans [i.e., the
commander’s] own benefit; and Counsell to the benefit of another man” (Hobbes 1991, 176–7).
Hobbes may have had a wider notion of purpose in mind in De Cive.\
\
The Hobbesian parentage of Raz’s analysis of law’s authority is clear from
this passage. However, Raz made a decisive break from Hobbes on the last
point—and it makes all the difference for his understanding of the point of au-
thority. Raz agreed that legitimate authority is not limited to serving the inter-
ests or promoting the well-being of its subjects. Nevertheless, he insisted that
authority is justified only when and to the extent that it serves those subject
to it. To be legitimate it need not serve their well-being, but it must improve
their rational well-doing. This service conception of authority comprises two im-
portant theses: the dependence thesis and the normal justification thesis (Raz
1986b, 42–57; 1995a, 214–5). The dependence thesis (DT) captures the idea
that authoritative directives are meant to reflect the balance of the subjects’
underlying reasons (Raz 1986b, 51)—that is to say, the point of having authori-
ties requires that “all authoritative directives should be based on reasons which
already independently apply to the subjects of the directives” (ibid., 47).[^15] This
thesis requires not only that the authority issue only those directives that can
be rationally justified, but also that the justification must be in terms of the
subjects’ underlying reasons for action. This leads us directly to the normal jus-
tification thesis (NJT) which holds that a person’s claim to authority is primari-
ly justified by showing that the alleged subjects are more likely to comply with
their underlying reasons if they follow the alleged authority’s directives than if
they act on their own assessment of those reasons (ibid., 53). Sometimes Raz
suggested that following authority is justified only if doing so maximizes the
subjects’ conformity to their underlying reasons (e.g., Raz 1980, 193–5), but
elsewhere he weakened this claim. He can do so because the normal justifica-
tion, when successful, offers only a necessary condition of a justified claim of
authority. A further necessary condition is that the claim to authority is widely
accepted, that is, the alleged authority must also enjoy de facto authority (Raz
1986b, 56). In that case, the relevant comparison will be reason-conformity
under the de facto authority with reason-conformity under unaided judgment.
The fact that some other person might be able to do an even better job than
the incumbent is not enough to defeat his claim to authority.


[^15]: He adds that they may also be based on other reasons, but just insofar as they enable
authorities to be better able to satisfy the normal justification thesis (Raz 1995a, 214 n. 6). Note:
throughout his discussion, Raz usually calls the subjects’ reasons on which the authoritative
directives must be based “dependent reasons.” This is misleading. Following his usage in Practical
Reasons and Norms (Raz 1990b, 193), I shall call them “underlying reasons.”

Justification of authority is instrumental. The relevant benefits are those of
improving the reason-conformity of an agent’s actions. One has reason to fol-
low the directives of an alleged authority if doing so “is the best way of acting
in accordance with those reasons which are reflected in the authoritative direc-
tives” (Raz 1990a, 6). Submission to authority is a rational indirection strategy:
“the case for authoritative rules depends on the advantages of the indirect ap-
proach, the attempt to maximize conformity with certain [underlying] reasons
[...] not through compliance with them but through compliance with an alter-
native set of reasons” (ibid., 193).
Taken together, DT and NJT constitute the “service conception of authority”
(Raz 1995a, 214). NJT implies that submission to authority is a rational indi-
rection strategy; DT guarantees that it is a specific kind of indirection strategy,
namely, submitting to a surrogate rational deliberator. The “service” that the au-
thority provides is deliberative. Reasons for acknowledging someone as a practi-
cal authority over one are reasons for having a certain matter decided by some-
one else. The “fundamental point about authority [...] [is that] it removes the
decision from one person to another” (Raz 1990b, 193). This is essential to the
argument for authority. NJT alone is not enough, because NJT could be satisfied
by an impersonal mechanism that generates directives for action in an oracular
fashion. No matter how much following its dictates might improve one’s reason-
conformity, doing so would not be a case of recognizing its authority. Authori-
ties, necessarily, Raz assumed, must be capable of rational deliberation and issu-
ing directives that can be presented as the products of that deliberation.
It is a very short step from this point to what Raz calls the preemption thesis
(PT), according to which the “fact that an authority requires performance of an
action is a reason for its performance which is not to be added to all other rel-
evant reasons when assessing what to do, but should replace some of them” (Raz
1995a, 214; 1986b, 46; 1990a, 6). Authoritative directives can do their valuable
work only if those who are subject to them take them as preemptive reasons.
Otherwise, there would be no point in accepting the authority. The service con-
ception of authority, then, makes rationally intelligible the claim authorities make
to issue preemptive directives. Authorities mediate between subjects and their
underlying reasons for action. This mediation is beneficial and rationally justified
just when and to the extent that it enables subjects to improve their ability to act
in conformity with reason. The same kinds of limits—subject-scope, substance-
scope, and external—apply to authority as to exclusionary reasons generally.
Thus, directives of legitimate authorities preempt only those reasons which (1)
the directives are meant to replace, provided (2) replacing them is consistent with
(a) the grounds for accepting the authority of those who posit them, and (b) the
constraints of the autonomy proviso are respected (Raz 1989, 1180–82).
If these limits are respected, submission to authority, under some cir-
cumstances and with respect to certain pairs of persons, may be rational and
even morally justified. It is not necessarily irrational for the same reason that
preemptive reasons are in principle rational: under some circumstances sub-
mission can realize important benefits of rational indirection. This is true even
if—as must be the case—that authority requires in some cases that one do
what is in fact not required on the balance of one’s underlying reasons. (This
must be the case, because it is a necessary feature of legitimate authority that
its directives bind even when mistaken.) It is rational to follow authority even
then (unless it is “clearly wrong”—Raz 1986b, 62), because the rationality of
following it depends on its promise of long-term reason-conformity. It is, in
principle, morally justified, again to the extent that authorities can credibly
promise to enable subjects to improve their compliance with what morality
requires of them. To the philosophical anarchist, who maintains that submis-
sion to authority even when this promise can be met is still immoral because it
is inconsistent with the subjects’ respect for their moral autonomy, Raz (1979,
26–7; 1986b, 38–42) replies that authority presents no fundamental challenge
to moral autonomy. First, it does not require “surrender of judgment,” as
philosophical anarchists charge, but only suspension of one’s action-oriented
judgment and “online” deliberation with respect to reasons falling within the
scope of the authority’s jurisdiction. Second, authority is legitimate only when
responsible moral agents have good reasons to submit, and when this is so they
can submit autonomously.[^16]

[^16]: This argument is inconclusive, because it leaves open the question of the scope of the
autonomy proviso. Some such proviso must be recognized, according to Raz; so the dispute with
the philosophical anarchist turns on how wide or demanding this proviso is. The philosophical
anarchist may argue that there is never sufficient reason to recognize the authority of law or
the state, since the matters they deal with are always of matters of moral concern which call for
responsible autonomous judgment of every moral agent. Raz’s conception of authority gives focus
to the debate between philosophical anarchists and their opponents but it does not resolve it.

8.4.2.3. Authority and Coordination
Arguments available to support the authority of government and law in the
spirit of the service conception of authority, in Raz’s view, are of two kinds:
appeals to expertise and appeals to the ability to solve broad problems of so-
cial coordination (Raz 1990a, 6; 1990b, 195).[^17] It is very difficult to mount a plausible argument from expertise for the claimed scope of authority of law or
government (Shapiro 2002a, 400) and Raz (1979, 9) conceded that expertise
plays only a subordinate role in the justification of political authority. As Leslie
Green once put the point, “There are experts on whales but not on whether
we should save the whales” (Green 1989, 804). In its most plausible versions,
the appeal to expertise combines in complex ways with appeals to social co-
ordination (Raz 1989, 1164; 1990a, 6). Appeal to the ability of law to secure
social coordination is the most likely candidate argument in justification of its
claim to authority (Raz 1989, 1164).

[^17]: He also hints at a third argument: that acknowledging the authority of law or government
makes possible the creation of a common culture in pluralistic communities (Raz 1986b, 58; 2001a,
18). The mediation offered by law enables citizens to act on “non-ultimate reasons” provided
by the authoritative directives, and the reasons for recognizing the authority of those institutions
issuing them, without having to appeal to more fundamental moral principles in every case (1986b,
61) and so “enables a common culture to be formed round shared intermediate conclusions, in
spite of a great degree of haziness and disagreement concerning ultimate values” (1986b, 181).
However, Raz does not develop this suggestion in any detail. For a sympathetic development
of Raz’s views along these lines see Waldron 2003 (and below chap. 12, sec. 12.4.2). Law and
Disagreement focuses directly on the role of law in a pluralistically divided society, but is critical of
the strong intentionalism implicit in Raz’s account of authority (Waldron 1999b, chap. 6).


Groups of all sizes, but especially complex modern societies, constantly
face problems of social coordination. Game theory offers a sophisticated set
of models of social coordination problems, including some, like the prisoner’s
dilemma and battle of the sexes, in which there is a large admixture of conflict
as well as cooperation; however, the problems modeled by game theory are
only a small part of the broader class of problems Raz (1989, 1189–94; 1990a,
7–10; 2003, 259–60) had in mind, which included all situations in which there
is some legitimate or compelling value, goal, or set of interests (not restricted
to the good or interests of the agents in view) that can be effectively promoted
or realized only through coordinated efforts of many different people. Coordi-
nation in such cases involves enabling people to act in ways that are sensitive to
how other people are likely to act, structuring their interactions to increase the
likelihood of achieving or realizing the end in view. In many such cases, people
are unable to solve on their own the coordination problems they face; they may
not even be aware of the existence of the problems. Coordination problems
exist, even when people are not aware of them, if they would be better able to
promote or realize values or goals that they have independent reason to pursue
if their interactions with others were coordinated.
Authorities can be in a position to identify problems of social coordina-
tion and to orchestrate solutions to them better than people on the ground,
Raz argued. Instructions of authorities can call public attention to a problem
and work out potentially complicated schemes of interaction that have some
hope of achieving the goal in view. Members of society, then, might have good
reason to follow authoritative directives in cases like these because they will
thereby participate (and enable others to participate) more reliably in justified
schemes of social coordination than if they were to strike out on their own (Raz
1989, 1192). This social coordination justification satisfies the DT constraint,
because (or to the extent that) those who are subject to the alleged authority
have reason to pursue the values, goals, or interests in view. It satisfies the NJT
constraint because (or to the extent that) people who follow the authoritative
directives are more likely to promote these values, goals, or interests than they
would be by following their own judgment. Thus, law can be seen as a kind of
“second order co-ordinating structure” that not only helps solve social coordi-
nation problems, but also identifies problems that need solving and publicly
marks those who are in a position to do both (Raz 1996b, 18). In this way, law
mediates between the actions and interactions of citizens, on the one hand, and
the reasons they have to act, on the other. Thus, an argument for law’s claim to
authority can intelligibly be made along these lines.
However, it is an interesting question whether government and law need
the trappings of authority to help us solve social cooperation problems (Re-
gan 1989, 1024–31; Alexander 1990, 7–8). The instructions or directives of law
work their magic by bringing to public attention certain problems and by pub-
licly marking certain structures of interaction. This marking makes the law’s
instructions salient and this has the effect of changing people’s behavior by
changing their expectations of the behavior of others. Thus, it is argued, law
can succeed in coordinating behavior without authority—that is, without is-
suing preemptive reasons of any kind, or even constituting independent rea-
sons for acting. They merely change the facts of (expectations regarding) social
behavior on the ground. To this criticism, Raz (1989, 1188) replied that the
way law achieves its salience is precisely through being generally recognized as
authoritative, so pre-emption and reason-giving are not dispensable. This re-
sponse needs elaboration. After all, it is not enough to show that in fact this
is usually what law does (or rather claims to be doing), because while law may
deploy the machinery of authority, the coordinating effect may actually be pro-
duced by the mere fact of being sufficiently public. Raz (1989, 1195) might
argue that as long as the option of working out the balance of reasons on their
own is known to be available to others, one would not have enough confidence
that they would in fact follow the law’s instructions, despite all signs of their
salience, and so the preemptive character of the authoritative directives gives
others the assurance they need to find it reasonable to follow the law. I am not
sure whether Raz would be inclined to endorse this argument, but he may have
reason to hesitate because the argument puts the preemptive status of law on
the same footing as that of coercion, which Raz (1990b, 157–62) argued was
not essential to law. In both cases, their role in practical reasoning would be
ancillary. Both of them work primarily not by offering us reasons to act, but
rather by assuring us that others will have sufficient reason to act—through
preemption or the threat of sanction—even if their primary reasons are repre-
sented by the fact that the law’s scheme of interaction promises success in co-
ordinating action and solving the social coordination problem they have reason
to have solved. It is an interesting question whether this is sufficient to support
the weight of Raz’s general argument for law’s authority.
