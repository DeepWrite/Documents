# III. Authority and Law

## 8. Authority and Second-Personal Reasons for Acting

In SPS, 1 I argue that a distinctive kind of reason for acting, a second-personal reason, is an ineliminable aspect of many central moral categories, including rights, moral responsibility, moral obligation, respect for and the dignity of persons, and the very concept of moral agent or person itself. Second-personal reasons are distinguished from reasons of other kinds by their conceptual relations to authoritative claims and demands that must be able to be addressed to those to whom they apply (second-personally, as it were). I have argued, more specifically, that there are four interdefinable, irreducibly secondpersonal notions: the authority to make a claim or demand, a valid (authoritative) claim or demand, accountability or responsibility to someone (with the relevant authority), and a second-personal reason for acting (that is, for complying with an authoritative claim or legitimate demand and so discharging the responsibility). Each one of these notions entails the other three, and no proposition that does not already involve one of these four concepts can entail any that does.

Call the authority I am concerned with practical authority to distinguish it from various forms of epistemic authority or expertise, including the kind of authority on practical matters a trusted adviser might have. A challenge that can be posed to my irreducibility thesis is that it is possible to establish claims to practical authority by invoking solely non-second-personal reasons. In what follows, I consider Joseph Raz's influential normal justification thesis according to which claims to practical authority can be established by showing that an "alleged subject" is likely to comply better with reasons that apply to him independently already if he accepts the directives of an alleged authority as binding and tries to follow them than he would if he were to act on his own assessment of independent reasons (Raz 1986: 53). I shall argue that the normal justification thesis does not hold for practical authority as I propose to understand it;2 moreover, that the correct diagnosis of why it does not shows that both practical authority and reasons that are conceptually related to it are irreducibly second personal.

<sup>1</sup> Darwall 2006. 2 Or more cautiously, any cases where it may hold will be by virtue of recourse to reasons that are themselves already within the circle of second-personal concepts (i.e., second-personal reasons).

<span id="page-154-0"></span>Let me try to get the intuitive idea of a second-personal reason across with an example. Compare, first, two different ways in which you might try to give someone a reason to stop causing you pain, say, to remove his foot from on top of yours.

One would be to get him to have sympathetic concern for you in your plight and to want you to be free of pain. In desiring this, he would see relief of your pain as a better way for the world to be, a possible outcome or state that, as Moore put it, "ought to exist for its own sake" (Moore 1993: 34). And he would most naturally see his desire, not as the source of the reason, but as a kind of access to an agent-neutral (and state-of-the-world-regarding) reason for removing his foot that is there anyway.3 The reason would not be essentially for him as the agent causing another person pain. It would apparently exist, most fundamentally, for anyone who is in a position to bring about the state of relief of your pain, and therefore for him, since he is well placed to do so.4 Finally, in "giving" him the reason in this way, you might not need to address or relate to him in any way at all. Anything that would get him to see your being in pain as a bad thing, like an unaddressed grimace or whimper, might serve. In no sense, not even epistemic, need he be taking any reason to move his foot on your authority.

Alternatively, you might lay a claim or address a purportedly valid demand. You might say something that asserts or implies your authority to claim or demand that he move his foot and that simultaneously expresses this demand. You might demand this as the person whose foot he is stepping on, thereby claiming and exercising what you take to be a right against him. Or you might demand it as a representative of the moral community, whose members understand themselves as holding themselves and one another to a (moral) obligation or demand not to step on each other's feet. Or you might do both simultaneously. Whichever, the reason you would address would be agent-relative rather than agent-neutral. It would concern, most fundamentally, your

3 On this point, see Darwall 1983; Bond 1983; Pettit and Smith 1990; Quinn 1993; Hampton 1998a; Scanlon 1998: 41–55; and Dancy 2000. Agent-neutral reasons contrast with agent-relative reasons, those whose formulation includes an ineliminable reference to the agent for whom they are reasons (like "that it will keep a promise I made," "that it will avoid harm to others, i.e., people other than me," and so on). Agent-neutral reasons can be stated without such a reference: "that it would prevent some pain from occurring to someone (or some being)." On the distinction between agent-relative (also called "subjective" or "agent-centered") and agent-neutral (also called "objective") reasons, principles, values, etc., see Nagel 1970; Scheffler 1982; Parfit 1984; Nagel 1986; Darwall 1986; McNaughton and Rawling 1991; and Ridge 2005.

I argue for the claim that sympathetic concern involves its seeming that there are agent-neutral reasons to further someone's welfare in Darwall 2002: 68–72. I do not deny, of course, that someone who already accepted various agent-relative norms might not be moved, through empathy and sympathy, to feel some special responsibility for relieving the pain. My point is that this would not come through sympathy alone. 4 Roughly speaking, again, a reason is agent-neutral if it can be formulated without essential reference to

the agent (as such); otherwise it is agent-relative. It should also be noted that superficially agent-relative reasons may be grounded more deeply in agent-neutral considerations and values, and/or vice versa. For example, rule-utilitarianism holds that rules of right conduct include agent-relative principles, for example, those defining rights of promise and contract, on grounds of overall agent-neutral value.

<span id="page-155-0"></span>addressee's relations to others, in this case, that his keeping his foot on yours causes another person pain, causes inconvenience, and so on, and that this is something we can and do reasonably demand that people not do. The reason would not be addressed to him as someone who is simply in a position to alter a bad state. If he could stop, say, two others from causing an identical gratuitous pain by the shocking spectacle of keeping his foot firmly planted on yours, this second, claim-based reason would not recommend that he do so. The reason would be addressed to him as someone who is a person causing gratuitous pain to another person, something we persons normally assume we have the authority to demand that persons not do to others.

What is important for our purposes is that someone can sensibly accept this second reason for moving his foot, one embodied in your claim or demand, only if he also accepts your authority to demand this of him (second-personally). That is just what it is to accept something as a valid claim or demand. And if he accepts that you can demand that he move his foot, he must also accept that you will have grounds for complaint or some other form of accountability-seeking response if he does not. And that third parties will have grounds for moral blame. Unlike the first reason, this latter is second personal in the sense that although the first is conceptually independent of forms of secondpersonal address involved in making claims and holding people responsible, the second is not. A second-personal reason is thus one whose validity depends upon presupposed authority and accountability relations between persons and, therefore, on the possibility of the reason's being addressed person-to-person within these relations. Reasons of this kind simply would not exist but for their role in second-personal address and in mediating our relatings to one another. And their second-personal character explains their agent-relativity. As second-personal reasons always derive most fundamentally from agents' relations to one another, they are invariably agent-relative at the most fundamental level.5

It is important also to see, however, that a norm or reason can be agent-relative without being second-personal; in other words, there might be a reason of yet a third kind that is agent-relative, like the second, but not yet a second-personal reason. We can imagine someone who accepts and scrupulously observes a universal norm

5 The formulation of the reason may not always be agent-relative, however. Suppose, for example, that the best way of grounding the Categorical Imperative is, as I argue in The Second-Person Standpoint, from the second-person standpoint in an equal authority to make claims and demands that persons presuppose when they address one another second-personally (32–5, 115–18, 239–42, 304–9). It is at least conceivable that what the CI itself requires is a principle of conduct that can be specified agent-neutrally. R. M. Hare, for example, believes that the CI can be seen to entail the sort of universal prescriptivism he favors and that this entails a form of act-utilitarianism (an agent-neutral theory). See Hare 1993.

I take the relevance of the arguments of The Second-Person Standpoint to the problem of justifying of agentrelative (or "deontological") constraints to be the following therefore. Justification from the second-person point of view can provide a compelling rationale for agent-relative constraints, like the demand not to step on another's feet, since, if I am right, any moral obligation or constraint is irreducibly second-personal, and second-personal reasons are agent-relative in their foundations. It is, however, conceptually consistent with this that moral obligations are agent-neutral in their content, and some presumably are, such as the obligation to help those in need. I am indebted to David Sobel and Steven Wall for pressing me to clarify this point.

<span id="page-156-0"></span>of foot-avoidance but who also denies, consistently with that, anyone's authority to claim or demand his compliance with this norm, hence denies that he is responsible to anyone for compliance, even to God. Such a person might conceive of the norm as mandatory in the sense of entailing categorical, indeed supremely authoritative reasons, without accepting that he is accountable to anyone for complying with it. However, he could not then consistently accept that anyone has a right to his foot-avoidance, and in respecting the norm of avoiding people's feet he would not be respecting them as persons, since he would not be recognizing any authority anyone might claim as a person to demand anything, in particular, that he avoid their feet (Feinberg 1980; Darwall 2004). Neither, in my view, could he consistently accept that he is morally obligated not to step on others' feet since moral obligation is related to moral responsibility conceptually. It is conceptually impossible for one to be morally obligated to do something but not responsible for doing it, neither to the moral community, nor to God, nor to anyone. So someone who thought he was accountable to no one could not think he was morally obligated not to step on others' feet, whatever priority he might give to a norm requiring him not to do so.

There is thus a significant difference between the idea of an authoritative claim or demand, on the one hand, and that of a valid (and in that sense authoritative) norm or normative reason, or even of a normative requirement, on the other. There can be requirements on us that no one has any standing to require of us. We are under a requirement of reason not to believe propositions that contradict the logical consequences of known premises, for example. But it is only in certain contexts, say, when you and I are trying to work out what to believe together, that we have any standing to demand that one another reason logically, and even here that authority apparently derives from a moral or quasi-moral aspect, namely, our having undertaken a common goal.6 Requirements of logical reasoning are, in this way, fundamentally different from moral requirements. I follow Mill and a number of contemporary writers in holding that it is part of the very idea of moral obligation that moral requirements are what those to whom we are morally responsible have the authority to demand that we do.7

6 Of course, these further constraints are frequently in the background, as they are, for example, whenever we do philosophy, say, right now. Because of the relationship you and I are currently in, each of us does have authority to call one another to account for logical errors, a standing that, without some such context, we lack. But however frequently that or some relevantly similar context obtains, the authority comes, not just from the requirement of reason, but from some other presupposed feature of the context. 7 "We do not call anything wrong, unless we mean to imply that a person ought to be punished in some

way or other for doing it; if not by law, by the opinion of his fellow-creatures; if not by opinion, by the reproaches of his own conscience. This seems the real turning point of the distinction between morality and simple expediency. It is a part of the notion of Duty in every one of its forms, that a person may rightfully be compelled to fulfil it. Duty is a thing which may be exacted from a person, as one exacts a debt" (Mill 1998: Ch. V.}14). John Skorupski points out that calling an act "morally wrong . . . amounts to blaming the agent" and maintains that the idea of moral wrong can't be understood independently of that of blameworthiness (Skorupski 1999: 29, 142). Allan Gibbard quite explicitly follows Mill's lead in proposing that "what a person does is morally wrong if and only if it is rational for him to feel guilty for having done it, and for others to be

<span id="page-157-0"></span>Clearly this is no part whatsoever of the concept of a demand of logic or a requirement of reason.8

Now, as I have said, second-personal reasons are related conceptually to, respectively, the authority to make a claim or demand, a valid or authoritative claim or demand, and responsibility or accountability to. To appreciate the second-personal aspect of moral responsibility, consider Strawson's famous critique of "pragmatist" or consequentialist approaches to responsibility in "Freedom and Resentment" (Strawson 1968). Strawson argued influentially that social desirability cannot provide a justification of "the right sort" for practices of moral responsibility "as we understand them" (1968: 74). When we seek to hold people accountable, what matters is not whether some sanction is desirable, either in a particular case or in general, but whether their actions are culpable and whether we have any authority to demand their acceptance of a sanction. Desirability is a reason of the wrong kind to warrant the attitudes and actions in which holding someone responsible consists in their own terms.

Strawson's point is an instance of the wrong kind of reason problem. To be a reason of the right kind, a consideration must justify the relevant attitude in its own terms. It must be a fact about or feature of some object, appropriate consideration of which could provide someone's reason for a warranted attitude of that kind toward it.9 The (morally) responsible and the culpable concern norms for the distinctive attitudes and actions that are involved in holding people responsible and blaming them. The desirability—whether moral, social, personal, or otherwise—of holding someone responsible or blaming her, or reasons why that would be desirable, are simply reasons of the wrong kind to warrant doing so in the sense that is relevant to whether she is morally responsible or blameworthy. The former concerns reasons and norms of desire (even if from the moral point of view), and what is thus desirable is simply a different question from whether we are justified in holding someone responsible or blaming her in the relevant sense. The latter concerns reasons and norms that are distinctively relevant to these latter attitudes.10

Strawson dubbed the distinctive attitudes involved in holding people responsible "reactive attitudes," with prominent examples being indignation, resentment, guilt, blame, and so on. And Strawson himself pointed out what more recent commentators, notably Gary Watson and Jay Wallace, have since also noticed, namely, that reactive attitudes implicitly address demands. They involve "an expectation of, and demand for"

angry at him for having done it" (Gibbard 1990: 42). And we can find versions of this Millian idea in other writers also (Baier 1966; Brandt 1979; Shafer-Landau 2003).

8 I am indebted to Peter Graham for this point. 9 Rabinowicz and Ronnøw-Rasmussen put essentially the same point by saying reasons of the right kind also appear in the content of the attitude for which they are reasons: the attitude is toward something "on account of" these reasons (Rabinowicz and Ronnøw-Rasmussen 2004: 414). As W. D. Falk pointed out, a favoring that is relevant to value is "by way of true comprehension of what [the object] is like" (Falk 1986: 117). See also Hieronymi 2005. 10 That is, to blame as an attitude. We also speak of blaming as an action, but even when we do we

normally take it to express the attitude of blame.

<span id="page-158-0"></span>certain conduct from one another11 (Strawson 1968: 85, emphasis added). To feel a reactive attitude is to feel as though one has a warranted expectation of someone. Reactive attitudes, and actions that express them, must therefore presuppose the authority to expect and hold one another responsible for compliance with moral obligations (which must then be standards to which we can warrantedly hold each other as members of the moral community). Strawson claimed also that holding one another responsible with reactive attitudes presupposes that those we hold responsible have that standing as well. In holding someone accountable in this way, we "view him as a member of the moral community; only as one who has offended against its demands" (Strawson 1968: 93). In these ways, reactive attitudes can mediate mutual accountability.

It follows on Strawson's analysis that culpability and moral responsibility are secondpersonal phenomena in my sense. They implicitly involve the address of authoritative claims and demands and, therefore, of second-personal reasons. Moral responsibility is responsibility to—in Strawson's view (and mine), to the moral community or to one another and ourselves as representative persons. It concerns what the moral community can warrantedly expect and demand of each other and themselves. When we hold one another responsible, we express these demands and presuppose the authority to do so. So if Strawson is right, as I think he is, then responsibility to is conceptually related to the idea of authoritative demands and, therefore, to practical authority and secondpersonal reasons, that is, to reasons for acting that are thought to consist in or to derive from authoritative demands.

But the conceptual relations also seem to run in the opposite direction. If one person has practical authority with respect to another, then this would seem to mean, not just that the latter has a reason of whatever priority or weight—whether overriding, silencing, exclusionary, pre-emptive, or whatever—for acting as the former directs, but also that the latter has some responsibility to the former for doing so, that the latter is, in some way or other, answerable to the former. This point can be illustrated by altering our earlier thought experiment to imagine someone, call him now B, who accepts a mandatory norm requiring him always to do what someone in a certain position tells him to do. Suppose that A is now in that position. B will then accept that he must do what A tells him to do. We can imagine that B thereby accepts a reason for complying with A's directives of whatever weight or priority. B might think that the reason always overrides, silences, or pre-empts any potentially conflicting reasons. But B could still deny, consistently with all of that, that he is in any way responsible or answerable to A (or, indeed, to anyone). Were he to do so, he would seem also to be questioning A's authority over him. "Just because I always have overriding or

<sup>11</sup> Gary Watson stresses this in Watson 1987: 263, 264. Note also, R. Jay Wallace: "there is an essential connection between the reactive attitudes and a distinctive form of evaluation . . . that I refer to as holding a person to an expectation (or demand)" (Wallace 1994: 19). See also Bennett 1980 and Scanlon (1998: 272–90).

<span id="page-159-0"></span>pre-emptive reason to do what you say doesn't make me answerable to you or give you authority over me," he might consistently say. A cannot have authority with respect to B, it seems, unless B is in some way answerable to A.

We might put this point by saying that practical authority is not just a relation in the logical sense; it is a standing in a relationship.12 If A has authority with respect to B, then certain things follow about how A and B may and must relate to one another. If A has the authority to demand that B stay off A's feet, then not only is it the case that B has a reason of whatever weight or priority for doing so on the occasion of such a directive. B is also answerable to A for doing so.

This point is illustrated further by early modern theological voluntarist moral theories, like those of Pufendorf and Locke. The fundamental premise of such theories is that God has superior authority over his creatures. It is absolutely central to the voluntarist picture, moreover, that, because God has authority over us, not only must we do what God says, but we are also accountable to Him for doing so. Unless we were responsible to God for compliance, any sanction God might attach to violating His commands would amount to coercion by threat. Of course, it might be within God's authority so to threaten us, but voluntarists like Pufendorf thought it critical to distinguish between even such justified threats and God's authority over us, which essentially includes His authority to hold us accountable with sanctions. For us to be God's subjects, so subject to His authority, Pufendorf thought, we must be able to see ourselves as responsible to Him for doing as He directs.13 (As we shall see, Raz also distinguishes between direction by justified threats and by authoritative directives.)

I take it, then, that there is a strong prima facie case for thinking that the four secondpersonal notions I mentioned at the outset—practical authority (to claim or demand), valid (authoritative) claim or demand, responsibility to, and second-personal reason for acting—are interdefinable in something like the following fashion.

Practical authority: Someone has practical authority with respect to another if, and only if, the latter has a second-personal reason to comply with the former's valid claims and demands and is responsible to the former for so doing.

Responsibility to: Someone is responsible to another if, and only if, the latter has the authority to make some valid claim or demand of the former that the former is thereby given a secondpersonal reason to comply with.

Valid claim or demand: A valid claim or demand is one that is within the authority of someone having practical authority with respect to another to make of the latter and that the latter thereby has a second-personal reason to comply with and some responsibility to the former for so doing.

Second-personal reason: A second-personal reason is one consisting in or deriving from some valid claim or demand of someone having practical authority with respect to the agent and with which the agent is thereby accountable for complying.

<sup>12</sup> I have been helped here by discussion with Jules Coleman. 13 For discussion see Darwall 2003.

<span id="page-160-0"></span>In SPS, I argue that many central moral concepts, including those of moral rights, moral obligation (and so, moral right and wrong), culpability, the dignity of persons, respect for persons, and the concept of moral agent or person (subject to moral obligations) are second-personal notions and so within the network of concepts just defined. For example, moral obligations are not just what there are moral reasons to do (of whatever weight); they are what morality demands and, therefore, that to which we can be justifiably held.

I claim, again, that the four interdefinable notions of practical authority, valid claim or demand, responsibility to, and second-personal reason are all irreducibly second personal. If this is so, then, to the extent that the moral categories I have just mentioned involve these notions, it will follow that they all have an irreducibly second-personal aspect also. In my view, this is a fact of great importance for moral theory. It means that no set of propositions that do not already involve the interdefinable second-personal notions I have identified can possibly entail any proposition of moral right, responsibility, obligation, and so on. To paraphrase a slogan of Bernard Williams's: Secondpersonal authority out, second-personal authority in (Williams 1985: 181).14 Of course, it may still be true that, for example, we are morally obligated to maximize overall utility, but this cannot possibly follow simply from the fact that the world would be better if we did. There must be some showing that this is something we reasonably demand of one another and hold ourselves and one another to through warranted reactive attitudes.

#### The Normal Justification Thesis and Accountability

But what makes it the case that someone has practical authority of any kind (as I contend, for example, that beings with second-personal competence share a basic authority as equal members of the moral community or that one person has authority of some kind over another)? And what makes it the case that any claim or demand from someone to another is valid, one that that person has the authority to make on the other? If it is possible to justify practical authority fully in terms of reasons that are not themselves second-personal, then perhaps the notions I have identified are not irreducibly second-personal. Maybe their apparently second-personal character is a superficial aspect that can be explained away or otherwise accounted for at some more fundamental level.

This is the challenge that is posed by Raz's normal justification thesis which Raz formulates as follows:

<sup>14</sup> Williams's slogan was "Obligation out, obligation in." One way of putting the thesis that moral obligation must be understood in terms of second-personal reasons is to say that the formulation in the text is not just a paraphrase of Williams's slogan, but that the point it formulates is the genus of which that formulated by Williams's slogan is a species.

the normal way to establish that a person has authority over another person involves showing that the alleged subject is likely better to comply with reasons which apply to him (other than the alleged authoritative directives) if he accepts the directives of the alleged authority as authoritatively binding and tries to follow them, rather than by trying to follow the reasons which apply to him directly. (1986: 53)15

Now the reasons that already apply to an "alleged subject" independently of the second-personal reasons putatively generated by some specific alleged authority may themselves be partly second personal, since they may be conceptually related to claims and demands of some other authority. This will turn out to be important if reasons of moral obligation are themselves second personal in the way I have claimed. On my view, moral obligations conceptually entail an authority all persons share to make demands of themselves and one another.

Of course, if the normal justification thesis is correct, then it may be possible to establish every authority, including whatever authority we have as equal members of the moral community, by reference to independently existing reasons. So it may be true that whatever standing we have to hold one another answerable for moral demands, like any other practical authority, can be accounted for by virtue of its being the case that we would do better, were we to accept this authority, at complying with reasons that apply to us independently of this authority. If, however, we can account for all practical authority by the normal justification thesis, then it would seem to follow that practical authority and the other notions that are conceptually related to it, although second personal on their face, are not irreducibly second personal.

Meeting the standards of the normal justification thesis is not, however, sufficient to establish practical authority. There are cases where one person might very well do better to follow someone else's directives where it seems clear that the latter has no claim whatsoever on the former's will and actions and consequently no practical authority with respect to him. And cases where an "alleged subject" would do better in complying with independent reasons where genuine authority does seem to be involved all also seem to involve some assumed background accountability relation that gives the authority's directives standing as second-personal reasons. In these cases, it is the latter that establishes the directives' authority, not the former.

It is worth pointing out that much of what Raz says about practical authority in The Morality of Freedom aside from the normal justification thesis seems well attuned to practical authority's second-personal character. First, Raz notes that authority of this kind is different, not only from power and coercive threats, but also from justified power and coercion. One does not exercise authority over "people afflicted with dangerous diseases," Raz notes, "if [one] knock[s] them out and locks them up to protect the public" even if one "is justified in doing so" (Raz 1986: 25). Such a justified use of

<sup>15</sup> We should note that Raz says here that this is the "normal way" to establish authority, not that it is a necessary, or even a sufficient condition. Since the normal justification thesis poses a critical challenge to my irreducibility claims only if it is taken as providing a sufficient condition, that is how I propose to understand it.

<span id="page-162-0"></span>coercion would miss, Raz says, an essential element of any exercise of authority purporting to give the person over whom it is exercised a distinctive reason to comply, namely, "an appeal for compliance" and "an invocation of the duty to obey" (25–6). This seems exactly right. Any such appeal would be an instance of what I am calling second-personal address. It would be an appeal to the alleged subjects to recognize the alleged authority and comply therefore with directives that are authorized by it. Moreover, someone can credibly make such an appeal only if he can expect his alleged subject to accept that the subject has some duty or obligation to follow his directives. Without such a duty or obligation in place, which an alleged authority cannot of course create by his own directives, no genuine authority exists.

Second, Raz makes an important distinction between the kind of authority that can give one new reasons for belief, including beliefs about what there is reason to do, on the one hand, and genuinely "practical authority" (as he also calls it), which can give one reasons for acting that one did not previously have, on the other. Raz rightly rejects a "recognitional conception" of practical authority according to which an authority gives agents no new reasons for acting, just new reasons to believe what reasons for acting they already have. Applying the "recognitional conception" to authority überhaupt gives rise to what Raz calls the "no difference thesis": "the view that authority does not change people's reasons for acting" (Raz 1986: 30). Raz points out that one way of seeing that the recognitional conception and no difference thesis cannot be correct is to reflect on the role that practical authority can play in solving coordination problems. There are cases where it is important for everyone to coordinate on one of two options that, so far as antecedently applicable reasons go, are equally choiceworthy. It is fine if everyone drives on the right, or on the left, but everyone had better coordinate on one side or the other. "A wise man," Raz notes, "can tell me which options belong" to a set of optimal choices, "but he cannot tell me which option to choose before it is known what others will do" (Raz 1986 30). This is, of course, correct. Raz rightly distinguishes between practical authority and the kind of authority that a trusted adviser can have in directing us to independently choiceworthy options. There is, as Hobbes famously noted, a distinction between "counsel" and "law" or "command" (Hobbes 1983: XIV.}1). Genuine practical authority can give those who are subject to it new reasons for acting by addressing valid claims or demands to those subjects. As I would put it, the relevant reasons are second-personal reasons; their validity depends on the alleged authority's actually having the authority he presupposes when he addresses the demand (or "appeal") for compliance.

Nonetheless, one might still think that what grounds practical authority and so makes it the case that someone can give reasons of this distinctive, second-personal kind are further reasons that are not themselves second personal. This brings us back to the normal justification thesis. The basic idea, again, is that someone earns practical authority with respect to another person if the latter would do better in complying with already applicable reasons were she to accept the former's directives "as authoritatively binding and tr[y] to act on them" than she would if she did not and tried to act

<span id="page-163-0"></span>on her own assessment of reasons. There is, however, a problem we face right at the outset in interpreting the normal justification thesis. What is it to accept someone's "directives as authoritatively binding"?

If we understand such acceptance to be accepting a directive as a valid demand in the second-personal sense I have been pointing to, then the alleged subject's own normative thought must then be interpreted in second-personal terms. In particular, we must suppose that she not only takes herself to have a reason of whatever weight or priority (exclusionary or pre-emptive, say), but that she also sees herself as responsible for compliance, that is, as answerable to the alleged authority. We must suppose that she, at least, takes it that the fact that she is thus responsible is in itself a reason for her to comply of this distinctively second-personal kind. But if this is so, then a version of Strawson's "wrong kind of reason" problem will arise from her perspective. Just as the fact that there might be desirable effects of treating people as responsible and their actions as culpable is a reason "of the wrong sort" for practices of holding people responsible "as we understand them," so also will the fact that an alleged subject would do better in complying with independently applicable reasons seem to her to be a reason of the wrong kind to think that she really is responsible for complying with some (alleged) authority's directives and therefore that his putative practical authority is genuine.

If this is right, then the beneficial effects of the subject's acceptance of an alleged authority may themselves be hostage to the subject's not also accepting the normal justification thesis herself, since the putative authority she accepts may then be susceptible, from her perspective at least, to, as Mill might put it, "the dissolving force of [the] analysis" that the normal justification thesis purports to provide.16 Were she to think that the only legitimacy the "alleged authority" can claim is that she would do better if she were to accept it, then this may tend to undermine her acceptance of it, and so its beneficial effects.

It seems more accurate to Raz's idea, however, to suppose that by accepting an alleged authority's "directives as authoritatively binding," Raz means nothing essentially second personal, but simply that the alleged subject takes the authority's directives as pre-emptive reasons, that is, reasons that are "not to be added to all other relevant reasons when assessing what to do," but that "exclude and take the place of [at least] some of them" (Raz 1986: 46). Thus A acquires practical authority with respect to B if B would do better in actually complying with independently applicable reasons if B were to treat A's directives as pre-emptive reasons in this sense.

<sup>16</sup> The reference is to Mill in a different context: "But moral associations which are wholly of artificial creation, when intellectual culture goes on, yield by degrees to the dissolving force of analysis: and if the feeling of duty, when associated with utility, would appear equally arbitrary; if there were no leading department of our nature, no powerful class of sentiments, with which that association would harmonize, which would make us feel it congenial, and incline us not only to foster it in others (for which we have abundant interested motives), but also to cherish it in ourselves—if there were not, in short, a natural basis of sentiment for utilitarian morality, it might well happen that this association also, even after it had been implanted by education, might be analyzed away" (1998, Ch. III.}97).

It is the pre-emptive character of the reasons that practical authority purports to create, according to Raz's analysis, that enables Raz to distinguish between genuinely practical authority and the kind of epistemic authority that a trusted adviser might have, that is, to make Hobbes's distinction between command and counsel. The only claim an adviser makes as such is on an advisee's beliefs about independently existing reasons and about what actions these reasons support, not directly on her will. "This is what I think you have good reason to do," an adviser might say, and add, "but I'm not for a moment telling or even asking you to do it," without canceling his advice or anything the advice implied. The improvements to the alleged subject's reason compliance that matter for the normal justification thesis are those that come, not from her being convinced by the alleged authority that there is sufficient independently existing reason to do as he suggests, but from her taking his instructions as directives that create pre-emptive reasons.

Raz does not consider what might be necessary for us actually to take (whether judge or in some less reflective way regard) someone's directives as giving rise to preemptive reasons. In my view, however, there is a problem here that is similar to the problem we set aside before of how it is possible to regard someone as having genuine authority if one holds the normal justification thesis. For as I see it, the normal way of taking someone's directives to provide pre-emptive reasons is to take it that he has practical authority in the second-personal sense I have been pointing to, namely, that one has an obligation to comply with his directives and is responsible to him for doing so. In other words, normally one must have authority to be able to give someone preemptive reasons by issuing a directive, and someone must normally regard one as having authority over them to take themselves to be given pre-emptive reason to comply with one's directives. I propose to set this problem aside also.

Now I take it that when Raz says that it is sufficient to establish that A has practical authority with respect to B if it can be shown that B would do better in complying with independently applicable reasons were B to accept A's directives as creating preemptive reasons, he means this to entail also that under such conditions A's directives actually do create such pre-emptive reasons. It is important to see, however, that these two theses can be distinguished. In fact, all three of the following theses are different:

- I. If B would do better in complying with independently existing reasons were B to treat A's directives as pre-emptive reasons, then B has sufficient reason so to treat A's directives.
- II. If B would do better in complying with independently existing reasons were B to treat A's directives as pre-emptive reasons, then A's directives actually are such pre-emptive reasons for B.
- III. If B would do better in complying with independently existing reasons were B to treat A's directives as pre-emptive reasons, then A has authority with respect to B (normal justification thesis).

It seems obvious that one could accept I without accepting II and accept both I and II without accepting III. Indeed, one could accept I and II without accepting the normal <span id="page-165-0"></span>justification thesis even if one thought that A's having authority with respect to B entails that A's directives are pre-emptive reasons.

For our purposes, however, we can simply put aside any reservations we might have about I and II and simply stipulate that both are true.17 Our question will still remain, namely, whether the satisfaction of the conditions of the normal justification thesis establishes, not just that the directives of an alleged authority should be taken as preemptive reasons or even that they are pre-emptive reasons in fact, but that the alleged authority is genuine.18

There seem to be clear cases, however, some that Raz himself considers, where it is hard to see how the normal justification thesis could possibly hold. Raz asks us to imagine that "John is an expert on Chinese Cooking" and that if one wants nothing but "to prepare the best Chinese meal [one] can [one] should just follow John's instructions" (64). Let us stipulate also that one has no reason to do anything other than prepare the best Chinese meal and therefore, following from our acceptance of II above, that John's instructions provide pre-emptive reasons. The question remains, does John thereby acquire any practical authority over one? It is hard to see how he does. Of course, one would be foolish not to follow his instructions, but if one did not it is difficult to see why John would have any standing to complain or otherwise hold one to account. Raz says that those with practical authority "have the right to replace people's own judgment on the merits of the case." But what right could John have in such a case? Or recall Raz's remark that, unlike merely justified coercion, genuine practical authority involves "an appeal for compliance" and "an invocation of the duty to obey" (Raz 1986: 25–6). How, in such a case, could John warrantedly expect that one would have any obligation to follow his instructions, however foolish one might be not to do so? It follows from our stipulations that John's instructions are not mere advice; they provide pre-emptive reasons. But it is hard to see how that gives John any right to our compliance with his directives or us any obligation to comply with them.

Raz's position about cases of this kind is somewhat equivocal. He grants that we would not ordinarily think that John would have any authority "over" one even if one's Chinese cooking would "prosper" by following his instructions, but points out that one can accept the normal justification thesis and still resist that John has such authority because one might think one would enjoy self-directed Chinese cooking more or have other goals. No doubt, but we can simply stipulate that one has no reason to do anything other than prepare the best Chinese meal, and it still does not seem to be

<sup>17</sup> For the record, however, I might say that II seems to me, as I argue in Darwall 2010c, almost certainly false. As I see it, the kinds of case where pre-emptive reasons are most plausibly in play are those that depend on the existence of (second-personal) practical authority. 18 Of course, Raz might hold that A's having authority over B is no more and no less than that A's

directives to B give B pre-emptive reasons. I consider this possibility below.

<span id="page-166-0"></span>the case that John has genuine practical authority as the normal justification thesis requires (64–5).

However, what if the reasons with which one would better comply themselves concern moral obligations? In such a case, an alleged authority would more plausibly appeal to an obligation to do as he directs. If the only way we can adequately comply with our moral obligations is to treat an alleged authority's directives as pre-emptive reasons, then there seems to be a sense in which it is plausible to suppose that we would be under an obligation so to treat them. Even so, it would not follow from this that the alleged authority himself thereby acquires any actual authority (beyond any he might have had already) to hold others to moral demands. After all, treating some appropriately programmed computer's "directives" as pre-emptive reasons might be no less effective, but neither the computer nor the programmer would thereby acquire any special practical authority by virtue of that.

Even if we could extend the scope of authority to an effective moral director by applying the normal justification thesis in such a case, this would still give us no reason to conclude that the second-personal appearances of practical authority can ultimately be explained away entirely by the normal justification thesis. The reason, as I argue in SPS, is that moral obligations provide second-personal reasons themselves (Darwall 2006). Moral obligations are what is warrantedly demanded of us, what we can warrantedly be held to. In the kind of case we are imagining, it is, at best, as if the alleged authority functions as a kind of representative who acquires any special authority he comes to have by virtue of the general authority to hold morally responsible. So even if the normal justification thesis tracks genuine practical authority in a case of this kind, it does so thanks to there being an assumed second-personal authority to hold people to moral demands in the background.

But suppose we attempt to explain the authority to hold people to moral demands itself by the normal justification thesis. If we try to do so based on improvements that would come in our compliance with reasons of other kinds then our moral philosophy will "rest on a mistake," in Prichard's famous phrase (Prichard 2002). Reasons of other sorts are reasons of the wrong kind for distinctively moral authority. But what if we say that moral authority derives from improvements that accepting it would make in our compliance with moral obligations themselves? How then are we to specify our moral obligations? If Mill and I are right, there is no way adequately to characterize what it is to be morally obligatory that does not already involve the authority to hold morally responsible.19 So we cannot explain moral authority itself by the normal justification thesis by claiming that we will do better in complying with moral obligations if we accept that authority, since nothing will count as a moral obligation unless there is already such a thing as the authority to hold morally responsible. I need not assume, of course, that it is impossible to designate moral obligations extensionally in

non-second-personal terms, for example, with some list like: acts of kind A in circumstances of kind C1, of kind B in circumstances of kind C2, and so on. The point will nonetheless remain that the mere fact that we will do better in performing acts on the list is impotent by itself to explain the authority to hold morally responsible, since an act's being morally obligatory, and so on the list, is not itself independent of the authority to hold morally responsible and make demands of one another.

Suppose, however, that Raz were to eschew talk of obligation in this sense "all the way down," and simply take the position that all he really means by a duty of obedience is that there are pre-emptive reasons for following an alleged authority's directives. Similarly, he might hold that the latter is all that it is for someone to have practical authority in the sense in which he has in mind. If we interpret the normal justification thesis as applying to practical authority defined in this way, it may seem more plausible. But it should be clear that practical authority so defined is not a thesis that entails anything about any right to obedience or about any obligation to obey, at least as we ordinarily understand rights and obligations. So understood, the normal justification thesis is simply a thesis about pre-emptive reasons. But if that is so, then it is not even relevant to the question of whether second-personal authority, demands, reasons, and responsibility, in the sense that I have delimited, can ultimately be accounted for in terms of considerations that are not themselves second personal.20

My conclusion is that the normal justification thesis poses no serious challenge to my claim that the four notions I have identified constitute a circle of interdefinable, irreducibly second-personal concepts. If we interpret the thesis as concerning practical authority, understood in second-personal terms, then it is either implausible or, in cases where it seems not to be, it borrows plausibility from the implicitly second-personal character of the reasons on which the alleged authority's directives are based (as when she directs us to comply with our moral obligations). And if we interpret the thesis otherwise, it just becomes a thesis about pre-emptive reasons for acting and so has no direct relevance to the possibility of grounding or otherwise explaining secondpersonal authority in non-second-personal terms.

Of course, even if the concepts of practical authority, valid demand, second-personal reason, and responsibility to I am pointing to are irreducibly second-personal in the ways I am claiming, that does not entail that any of these concepts are actually instantiated, that is, that there are any second-personal reasons, is any second-personal authority, and so on. So we might regard a position like Raz's as a kind of skepticism about practical authority of the kind I am pointing to and as offering a "reforming definition" in the style of Stevenson or Brandt in terms of pre-emptive reasons. I cannot, of course, establish here that the unreformed second-personal ideas I have

<sup>20</sup> And it may also be the case, as I mentioned in note 17, that pre-emptive reasons themselves normally plausibly exist only when there has been a directive with genuine (second-personal) practical authority.

<span id="page-168-0"></span>described are anything other than what Kant calls "figment[s] of the mind."21,22 However, if what I have said here is correct, it will follow that if these ideas are mere figments, then so are the ideas of moral right, responsibility, and obligation and, indeed, the very concept of moral agent or person itself.23

21 At the end of Chapter II Groundwork points out that his arguments that autonomy of the will, the unqualified goodness of the good will, and the Categorical Imperative are mutually entailing has derived from an analysis of our moral concepts, and that nothing yet follows from this about whether any of these are actually realized or valid. That, he says, requires a "critique" of practical reason, to which he turns in

## 9. Authority and Reasons: Exclusionary and Second Personal

In SPS, I argue that a distinctive kind of reason for acting, a second-personal reason, is an ineliminable element of many central moral categories, including rights, moral responsibility, moral obligation, the dignity of (and respect for) persons, and the concept of moral agent or person itself (Darwall 2006). Second-personal reasons are distinguished from reasons of other kinds by their conceptual connection to authority and to authoritative claims and demands that must be able to be addressed to those to whom they apply. I call these reasons second-personal to highlight this relation to address, which is necessarily always to someone (an addressee) and so in that sense second personal, even when the addressee is oneself, the public at large, or anyone at all, real or imagined.

More specifically, I argue that there are four interdefinable, irreducibly secondpersonal notions that together define a conceptual circle: the authority to make a claim or demand, a valid (authoritative or legitimate) claim or demand, accountability or responsibility to someone (with the relevant authority), and a second-personal reason for acting (that is, for complying with an authoritative claim or demand and so discharging the responsibility).1 Each of these notions entails the other three, and no proposition that does not already involve one of these four concepts can entail any that does. Whenever we take up a second-person standpoint and address or acknowledge a claim or demand, I argue, we necessarily reason within this circle of second-personal concepts. And I argue further that we are thereby committed to a basic secondpersonal authority we share with our reciprocal others as second-personally competent, that is, as beings able to enter into relations of mutual accountability at all.

In a more recent paper (Darwall 2009), I consider a challenge that might be posed to my claims about the irreducibly second-personal element in these central moral concepts based on Joseph Raz's "service conception of authority," specifically, on what Raz calls the "normal justification thesis" (NJT). The kind of authority that Raz and I are both concerned with is practical authority, as distinguished from various forms

<sup>1</sup> I take "accountability" and "answerability" to be synonyms that refer to a distinctive kind responsibility to someone. There are of course other forms of (ethical) responsibility. Cf. Gary Watson's distinction between "responsibility as accountability" and "responsibility as attributability" in Watson 1996.

of epistemic authority or expertise, including the kind of authority on practical matters that a trusted adviser might have. Raz argues that the claim that one person (A) has authority over another (B), entailing that A has the right to B's obedience and B a correlative duty to obey, can be justified by its being the case that B would be likely to comply better with reasons that apply to him independently already were he to accept as binding and act on the directives of an alleged authority than he would if he were to act on his own assessment of reasons (Raz 1986: 53). In other words, claims to genuine practical authority can be justified if one would better comply with reasons were one to accept these claims and treat them as valid.2

The objection to my irreducibly claim would then proceeds as follows. If the reasons with which an agent would better comply were not themselves second-personal reasons, it would then follow that someone could acquire practical authority over her owing entirely to non-second-personal considerations. So there might be good arguments to second-personal claims (e.g., A's authority over B and consequently A's authoritative demands of B) that do not depend on premises in which second-personal concepts and reasons figure in any way.

Against this possibility, I argue (in the paper just mentioned) that our concept of practical authority involves a conceptual connection to accountability and that satisfying the conditions of the Normal Justification Thesis cannot be guaranteed to secure this. The kinds of case in which the NJT has any plausibility, I claim, are those in which the reasons with which following a putative authority's directives secures better compliance already themselves assume background accountability relations that are critical to establishing the directives' legitimacy or authority. The rough idea is that the NJT is only plausible at all in cases where the relevant reasons involve background obligations of some kind or other and that the idea of obligation is itself conceptually related to that of accountability (I argue, ultimately to one another as representative persons or members of the moral community). If the reasons with which I will better comply have no connection to anything I am answerable for doing (independently of the directive), then it is simply not true that someone can come to have authority over me by virtue of the fact that I would better comply with those reasons were I to treat her directives as authoritative and follow them.

For example, I assume that I have prudential reasons to provide for my retirement that are independent of any obligations I might have, say, to provide for others whom I am answerable for supporting or of any obligation to support myself. It seems obvious that I do have such reasons and, moreover, that however important or valuable it might be for me to make my own choices, this latter value might not override (or sufficiently inform) the prudential reasons so that it could indeed make sense for me in prudential

<sup>2</sup> For ease of exposition, I will sometimes use "better comply with reasons" as synonymous with "better comply with reasons that apply to the agent already, that is, independently of the putatively authoritative directive."

terms to put myself in the hands of a financial expert and simply follow her directives.3 Suppose, then, that I would better comply with the relevant prudential reasons if I were to do so and that there are no other reasons, or at any rate no sufficient reasons, for me not to do so. (We should note that the kind of case we need is not just one where I would do better to follow an expert's advice, that is, by treating her as an epistemic authority on the theoretical question of what there is reason for me to do, but where I would do better if I were to treat her as having practical authority over me, hence the standing to issue legitimate directives to me, in other words, as being in a position not just to tell me what I should do, but to tell me to do it.)4

I argued that however desirable it might be for me to place myself in someone's hands in this way, even to the point of treating her as though she had practical authority over me, it simply would not follow that she actually has this authority. In order for her legitimately to claim authority over me, I would have to be answerable to her, and actually being answerable to someone cannot follow from the desirability (even, indeed, the moral desirability (in at least some senses of that phrase)), of regarding oneself (or of someone's regarding one) as answerable to her. Following Strawson's line of argument in "Freedom and Resentment," I argued that reasons that establish the desirability of treating someone as answerable to another person (or of his so treating himself), specifically, because he would thereby do better in complying with nonsecond-personal reasons that apply to him independently, are simply reasons of the wrong kind to show that he actually is answerable to that person (Strawson 1968). (Reasons of the right kind, I claimed, are irreducibly second personal.) So if, as I argued, authority entails answerability, then the NJT fails, and no objection can be mounted on its basis to my claims in SPS that central moral concepts, like those of moral obligation, responsibility, rights, and so on, are irreducibly second personal. No authority to make claims and demands can be based entirely on non-second-personal reasons.

Of course, Raz might for his purposes restrict the NJT to cases where the relevant reasons already entail some kind of answerability (although not, of course, the specific answerability of B to A that simply follows from A's having practical authority over B). I did not argue against this possibility, though I believe that, even so restricted, the NJT is unlikely to be true and that the right way to justify claims of differential practical authority—e.g., of legal and political authority—is within a contractualist framework grounded in the premise that all persons share a common basic (second-personal) authority to make claims and demands of one another at all.5

<sup>3</sup> This is necessary to satisfy what Raz has recently called the "independence condition" (Raz 2006). 4 According to the NJT it is accepting "the directives of the alleged authority as authoritatively binding,"

that must produce the improvement in reason compliance. Cf. Hobbes's distinction between law or

command and counsel (Hobbes 1994: XXV). 5 I discuss the relation between second-personal authority and contractualism in Chapter 12 of Darwall 2006.

And Raz might also simply reject my conceptual thesis that practical authority entails accountability and argue that the NJT applies to a concept of authority that lacks this entailment.6 I have my doubts that Raz and I really do have different concepts in mind, since he talks also of the authority's "right" to a subject's obedience and the subject's "duty" to obey. But perhaps these notions might be given readings that do not entail accountability also.

Indeed, Raz's preemption thesis suggests how this might be done. A core idea of Raz's theory of practical authority is that an authoritative directive provides "a reason for behaving as it directs, as well as an exclusionary reason, that is, a reason for not following (that is, for not acting for) reasons that conflict with the rule" (Raz 2006: 1022). Specifically, an authoritative directive "preempts" or "excludes" any reasons against performing any action it prescribes that the authority can be presumed to have taken into account in deciding to issue the directive.

This suggests that we might attempt to put the idea of accountability to one side and simply ask whether, if the conditions specified by the NJT are satisfied, this guarantees that the relevant reasons are in fact created. According to Raz in The Morality of Freedom, an authoritative directive creates a "preemptive reason" to act as it directs (Raz 1986: 42). In the Postscript to the 1990 second edition of Practical Reason and Norms, Raz says that "mandatory rules," of which "directives issued by authority are one subspecies," create "protected reasons," which consist in a "systematic combination of a reason to perform the act . . . required by the rule, and an exclusionary reason not to act for [conflicting] . . . reasons" that the authority can be presumed to have taken account of in deciding to issue the directive (Raz 1990: 191). I will follow Raz's earlier usage and refer to preemptive reasons as the reasons that a putative authority purports to create, that is, a positive (or first-order) reason for acting as the authority directs together with a (second-order) exclusionary reason not to act on conflicting firstorder reasons.7

Even if, consequently, the NJT were to fail as an account of practical authority as involving a standing to hold accountable, it might nonetheless succeed as an account of authority as the capacity to create preemptive reasons. Similarly, a Razian might understand the idea that authoritative directives create binding obligations in terms of their creating the relevant preemptive reasons.

My object in this paper is to argue that the NJT fails here as well. Although I agree with Raz that the capacity to create preemptive reasons (that is, to create exclusionary reasons not to act on reasons that would otherwise have force along with a new reason that "displaces" or preempts the excluded reasons) is a mark of practical authority, I believe that this capacity itself requires the second-personal relation of accountability. In a slogan: "No preemptive reasons without the standing to hold accountable." If, as

<sup>6</sup> As I point out in Darwall 2009. 7 For discussion on exclusionary reasons and their relation to preemptive reasons, I am indebted to Scott Hershovitz, David Enoch, Steven Wall, and Scott Shapiro.

<span id="page-173-0"></span>I maintain, the latter can be established only within a second-personal framework, it will follow that the former requires a second-personal framework also.

#### Second-Personal Reasons

Before I proceed to attempt to make this case, I should say something more about second-personal reasons and the Strawsonian lesson, as I interpret it, namely, that reasons "of the right kind" for establishing accountability claims can arise only within the second-personal conceptual network.

Suppose someone is stepping on your foot. There might be various different reasons for him to get off. One would simply be the fact that he is causing you pain and that this pain is bad for you or a bad thing period. Whether or not anyone does wrong or violates others' rights by gratuitously causing them pain, there is some reason not to cause them pain simply in the badness of pain or in its being bad for the person who is subjected to it.

Suppose, however, that you take yourself to have a right (specifically, a "claim right") not to be caused pain. Were you to think that, you would have also to think that you have as right holder some standing or authority to claim or demand that people not step on your feet without your consent and, specifically, that the person currently stepping on your foot not have done so, that he get off, and so on (Feinberg 1980: 155). Moreover, you must also think that you have some standing, again as the right holder, to hold the person accountable for having stepped on your foot, for example, to object, to ask him his reasons, to demand an apology, to forgive him if he apologizes, and so on. Since the idea of a right is connected in this way to the (right holder's) authority to claim or demand and hold accountable, it is a second-personal reason.

The authority one has as a right holder is not, however, the only relevant standing in this case. Although the victim of wrongdoing has the distinctive standing to resent or forgive an injury, he has no special standing others do not have to blame the wrongdoer or to hold him responsible through (what Strawson called "impersonal") reactive attitudes such as indignation.8 This is an authority that anyone has as a representative of the moral community, indeed, that the wrongdoer has himself and that he exercises when, in blaming himself, he feels guilt.

If it is wrong to cause gratuitous pain, this is a reason not to do so, perhaps, indeed a conclusive reason.9 And if, as I believe,10 the idea of moral wrong is conceptually connected to accountability—what is wrong is what we are answerable to one another as representative persons for not doing—then the fact that it would be wrong is a

- 
<sup>8</sup> Though it is not distinctively up to the victim whether to have the attitude of blame, the victim may have a distinctive standing to blame the wrongdoer overtly. I am indebted to an anonymous referee for prompting me to clarify this point. 9 I argue for this claim in Darwall 2010a. 10 And argue in Darwall 2006.

<span id="page-174-0"></span>second-personal reason for anyone not to cause gratuitous pain by stepping on your foot.11 Both reasons—that it would violate your right and that it would be wrong conceptually entail authorities to address demands (second personally).

Second-personal reasons exist only if the relevant authorities also exist to address and acknowledge claims and demands. The two reasons I just mentioned depend, respectively, on your standing as an individual right holder, on the one hand, and your and any other person's authority as representative persons or members of the moral community, on the other. Both involve an authority to make claims and demands and to hold accountable, although in different ways.

To appreciate the second-personal aspect of moral responsibility, consider Strawson's famous critique of "pragmatist" or consequentialist approaches to responsibility in "Freedom and Resentment." Strawson argued influentially that social desirability cannot provide a justification of "the right sort" for practices of moral responsibility "as we understand them" (Strawson 1968: 74). When we seek to hold people accountable, what matters is not whether some sanction is desirable, either in a particular case or in general, but whether their actions are culpable and whether we have any authority to demand their acceptance of a sanction. Desirability is a reason of the wrong kind to warrant the attitudes and actions in which holding someone responsible consists in their own terms.

Strawson pointed out what more recent commentators like Gary Watson and Jay Wallace have since also noted, namely, that reactive attitudes implicitly address demands. They involve "an expectation of, and demand for" certain conduct from the object of attitude (Strawson 1968: 85).12 To feel a reactive attitude is to feel as though one has a warranted expectation of someone. Reactive attitudes, and actions that express them, must therefore presuppose the authority to expect and hold one another responsible for compliance with moral obligations (which must then be standards to which we can warrantedly hold each other as representative persons or members of the moral community).

Reactive attitudes differ from other critical attitudes in that they don't merely have objects; they implicitly address their objects. Compare, for example, blame, indignation, or resentment, on the one hand, with (non-reactive) attitudes like disgust, contempt, or disdain, on the other. The former implicitly address a charge to their objects, while the latter do not. This is why the former, but not the latter, involve or presuppose a view of their objects as having some competence to understand or

<sup>11</sup> Of course, the fact that it would cause gratuitous pain is a reason why it would be wrong to step on your foot. I believe, however, that the fact that causing pain in this way amounts to doing wrong is a further, second-personal, and conclusive reason for not stepping on your foot that is additional to this wrong-making reason. On this point, see Darwall 2010a. 12 Watson 1987: 263, 264. R. Jay Wallace: "there is an essential connection between the reactive attitudes

and a distinctive form of evaluation . . . that I refer to as holding a person to an expectation (or demand)" (Wallace 1994: 19).

<span id="page-175-0"></span>appreciate the charge.13 We can think someone an "egregious blockhead," in Hume's phrase, without thinking him capable of understanding our contemptuous criticism. To the contrary, a really egregious blockhead is incapable of seeing what a blockhead he is. However, we can only intelligibly blame and hold accountable individuals we think capable of understanding and internalizing our blame, that is, of seeing themselves as being to blame, thereby holding themselves responsible.14

It follows on Strawson's analysis that culpability and moral responsibility are secondpersonal phenomena. Holding someone accountable involves an implicit address of authoritative demands and, therefore, of second-personal reasons. But the conceptual relations also run in the opposite direction. If one person has practical authority with respect to another, then this would seem to mean not just that the latter has a reason of whatever priority or weight for acting as the former directs, but also that the latter is answerable for doing so. Practical authority is not just a relation in the logical sense; it is a standing in a relationship.15 If A has authority with respect to B, then certain things follow about how A and B may and must relate to one another. If A has the authority to demand that B stay off A's feet, then not only is it the case that B has a reason of whatever weight or priority for doing so. B is also answerable to A for doing so. I take it, then, that there is a strong prima facie case for thinking that the four second-personal notions I mentioned at the outset—practical authority (to claim or demand), valid (authoritative or legitimate) claim or demand, accountability to, and second-personal reason for acting form an interdefinable circle of irreducibly second-personal concepts.

#### The Normal Justification Thesis and Exclusionary Reasons

We can turn now to considering whether the NJT provides an adequate justification for practical authority, specifically, of the sort one person has over another when she has the standing to issue directives to another that the latter thereby has some obligation to obey. Here is Raz's formulation of the NJT in Morality and Freedom:

the normal way to establish that a person has authority over another person involves showing that the alleged subject is likely better to comply with reasons which apply to him (other than the alleged authoritative directives) if he accepts the directives of the alleged authority as authoritatively binding and tries to follow them, rather than by trying to follow the reasons which apply to him directly. (Raz 1986: 53)

As I mentioned above, I argue in the earlier paper that if we take the relevant authority and resulting obligation to analytically entail accountability, that is, that being subject

<sup>13</sup> And it explains their distinct connection to the problem of freedom of the will in a way that other critical attitudes are not. 14 There are of course exceptions, e.g., blaming the dead. I am indebted here to an anonymous referee. 15 I have been helped here by discussion with Jules Coleman.

<span id="page-176-0"></span>to authority essentially involves answerability, then the NJT fails, at least that it does so when the reasons with which the person would comply better are not themselves second-personal reasons. In cases where the reasons do not concern anything one is already answerable for, then the fact that one would comply better with these reasons if one were to treat someone's directives as authoritative and make oneself answerable to that person for complying with the directives cannot establish that one is accountable to her in fact.

This, again, is the lesson of Strawson's "Freedom and Resentment." The fact that I would do better in complying with the prudential reasons concerning provision for my retirement if I were to put myself in the hands of a financial expert to the point of treating her directives as authoritative and myself as accountable to her for complying with them, cannot establish that I actually am answerable to her or that she has any standing to hold me to account for complying with her directives.16 We can simply stipulate that I have no better reason to do anything other than what is necessary to provide for my retirement, that this is what I have most reason to do all things considered, and it will still not follow that I would actually be accountable in such a case. However weighty the reasons connected with the desirability of providing for my retirement might be, so long as I am not answerable for doing what they recommend, these reasons are simply of the wrong kind to establish that I would actually be accountable. In Hobbes's terms, reasons of this kind are sufficient to establish good "counsel" but not "law" or "command" (Hobbes 1994: xxv.}1).

But suppose, again, that Raz were to maintain that whether or not the NJT fails for authority as essentially involving accountability, it nonetheless holds for authority as the capacity to create preemptive reasons? 17 We can put to one side the question of which concept of practical authority is "ours" and consider whether if we take the capacity to create preemptive reasons as the mark of practical authority, the NJT succeeds for authority so conceived. In other words, is satisfying the conditions of the NJT sufficient (or necessary) to establish that one person has the standing to create preemptive reasons for another?

The Razian idea of a preemptive reason includes that of an exclusionary reason. An exclusionary reason is a reason that does not count in favor of or against an action in the way "first-order" reasons do; it is a "second-order" reason against acting on certain first-order reasons. The idea underlying Raz's preemption thesis is that in deciding what directives to issue, an authority will take account of first-order reasons, at least within some range, for and against actions that would be prescribed by directives the authority is considering and that an authoritative directive preempts

<sup>16</sup> Of course, she might acquire this standing if I put myself in her care, depending on how she and

I understand the terms of the relationship into which we voluntarily enter. 17 Alternatively, Raz might hold that though our concept entails accountability, this is not an entailment we can adequately support or vindicate, and offer an NJT based account in terms of preemptive reasons as a "reforming definition" in the spirit of Richard Brandt or Charles Stevenson.

<span id="page-177-0"></span>the reasons for acting that the authority has already taken into account, specifically, it preempts or excludes the reasons for performing any action that would violate the directive. So an authoritative directive both creates an additional reason for doing what the directive prescribes that would not otherwise exist—namely, that so acting is required by an authoritative directive—and it creates an exclusionary reason against acting on any reason in favor of actions that would violate the directive, which reasons the authority can be assumed to have taken into account in deciding to issue the directive.

For example, suppose the state decides to impose a certain speed limit, say 65 miles per hour on a certain road. In deciding what speed limit to set, the state will balance complex considerations concerning safety, fuel economy, citizens' convenience, other economic factors, and so on. Once, however, the speed limit has been set, it is no longer permissible for citizens simply to make their own judgments about what speed to drive based on their own assessments of these and other relevant reasons. That is no longer within their discretion. The authoritative directive both gives them a reason to drive no faster than 65 miles per hour that they would otherwise not have had and a reason not to act on reasons for driving faster that they might have otherwise legitimately regarded as counting in favor of so doing, e.g., that they would thereby more conveniently arrive at their destinations sooner, are able to drive safely at a faster speed, and so on.

Suppose then we ask whether the NJT holds for authority as the capacity to create exclusionary reasons along with an additional reason for doing what the authority directs, which together comprise a preemptive reason? I shall argue that it does not. The conditions of the NJT are satisfied when a person would do better in complying with the reasons that apply to him already anyway were he to treat someone as an authority and treat her directives as legitimate. Now again, in my view, when we treat someone as having authority over us, we see ourselves as accountable to that person. But whether I am right about that or not, we are ignoring the element of accountability at this stage. Our question at this point is whether if someone does better in complying with reasons if he treats another person's directives as giving him preemptive reasons, this is sufficient to establish that the preemptive reasons actually exist. Is that sufficient, in other words, to establish the existence of a positive reason to comply and a second-order reason not to act on first-order reasons recommending non-compliance?18

It will be useful to have before us now the following three propositions to help us focus the issues:

<sup>18</sup> For convenience, from here on when I say "if he treats A's directives as giving him exclusionary means," I will mean, "if he treats A's directives as giving him an additional reason for acting as she directs and as giving him exclusionary reasons not to act on reasons that might otherwise recommend against the action she prescribes."

- <span id="page-178-0"></span>I. B will do better in complying with reasons if he treats A's directives as giving him preemptive reasons.
- II. There is reason for B to treat A's directives as giving him preemptive reasons.
- III. A's directives actually do give B preemptive reasons.

Now I am prepared to stipulate that when I is true, II is true also. We can simply agree for purposes of the argument that if someone would comply better with reasons were he to perform some action or adopt some attitude, then there is reason for him to perform that action or adopt that attitude.19 The question before us is whether if II is true, then III is guaranteed to be true as well. I believe that this is not the case. For III to be true whenever II is true, the reasons that speak in favor of B's believing that A's directives create exclusionary reasons, or B's regarding or treating A's directives as creating them, would also have somehow to make B's belief or way of seeing or treating things true or correct. And that is not generally the case. As D'Arms and Jacobson put the point, not all reasons for having an attitude are reasons of the right kind to show that attitude to be "fitting," that is, that it fits what it purports to represent (D'Arms and Jacobson 2000b). In this case, not all reasons for regarding or treating directives as creating preemptive reasons are relevant to whether the directives actually do create preemptive reasons.

For example, suppose that I would comply better with reasons for acting if I just had some false belief. Suppose, somewhat like Kavka's toxin puzzle, that someone will give me a prize enabling me to provide better for my children if I just believe, say, that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was an unqualified success in every respect. Assume that what I have most reason to do is to provide for my children, which I will be able adequately to do only if I form this belief and so win the prize. Clearly I would have reason to (try anyway) to form the belief (surrounding myself with relevant political propaganda and avoiding reputable news sources). But the reasons for doing so would not be reasons of the right kind to bear on whether the belief is actually true or credible. Only evidence can do that and pragmatic reasons for forming a belief are not evidence of a belief 's truth or credibility.

Admittedly, this case has a different shape than those where the conditions of the NJT are satisfied. In this case, the false belief is necessary to give me the means to accomplish what I have reason to try to accomplish. I might, after all, form the belief, get the prize, and then not actually end up providing for my children. Perhaps I would spend the money foolishly on expensive antiquarian books. But the general point nonetheless still stands, namely, the fact that one has reason to adopt an attitude does not in general make it the case that the attitude is true, correct, or "fitting."20 We might, therefore, reasonably be suspicious about whether if II is true, III will be guaranteed to be true also. Why should the fact that one has reason to regard or treat

- 19 For the record, I doubt that this is true. 20 This, of course, is just the "wrong kind of reasons" problem.
<span id="page-179-0"></span>someone's directives as creating exclusionary reasons make it the case that their directives actually do create such exclusionary reasons?

Let us focus now on that question, and to vary the case, suppose that what B has most reason to do is to get out of bed at a certain time, say, 7 a.m. We can suppose, again, that B has conclusive prudential reasons for doing so and no better reasons to do anything else. One thing B might do, of course, is to use an alarm of some kind. Let us suppose, however, that the usual alarms do not work for B. They wake him up all right, but when they do, he then deliberates about whether to get up and invariably persuades himself (against, let us suppose, his better judgment) that he has more reason to stay in bed a little longer. Suppose further that there is no other technical fix to B's problem. For example, if he puts the alarm far enough out of reach so that he has to get out of bed to turn it off, the ring from that distance is not loud or annoying enough to get him out of bed.

As it happens, however, B has an authoritarian personality. Whereas some people have bumper stickers saying "Question Authority," B's car displays one saying "Respect Authority." And B is the kind of person who, were he a subject in the Milgram experiment, would administer shocks up to the full 450 volts (Milgram 1974). So B gets an "authority alarm clock." The clock has a recording of an authoritative voice that says "You must get out of bed now." And if B stays in bed, the voice says things like "If you don't get out of bed, you will be found in violation and made subject to the full authority of the state," and so on. Suppose that this works and that it is the only way that B can reliably get out of bed at 7 a.m. as he has most reason to do. And suppose that the way it works is by giving B an "authority experience," that is, it is by making it seem to him as if someone with genuine authority is ordering him to get out of bed, that he must comply or be in violation, and so on.

Now if what B has most reason to do is to get out of bed at 7 a.m., then it would seem that B also has reason to treat the voice as actually issuing authoritative directives that create exclusionary reasons, as his "authority experience" indeed inclines him to do.21 That is, B has reason to treat his authority experience as though it were veridical. But it is also obvious that whatever weight the reasons B might have to get out of bed at 7 a.m. and so to treat his experience as veridical, these reasons cannot actually make his experience veridical or even bear on its accuracy. They would be completely impotent to make it the case that the alarm's "directives" actually are legitimate or genuinely create preemptive reasons. When the alarm clock goes off and the voice speaks, B has the very same reasons to get up at 7 a.m. and, by hypothesis, the same less weighty reasons to continue to lie in bed.

21 Of course, it might be argued that there is no actual directive in this case, but only the illusion of one, so that the letter of the NJT is not satisfied. While this seems a fair point, it also seems clear that the psychic mechanism leading to B's "compliance" is the same as might be involved in many cases of genuine compliance with actual directives, for example, in the Milgram experiments themselves, or in the case to be described presently. I am indebted to David Owens for this objection.

<span id="page-180-0"></span>Granted, B has pragmatic reasons to respond to the alarm, on the one hand, and, on the other, not even to think about his reasons for staying in bed (since if he does consider them he is likely to act contrary to the weightier reasons and stay in bed). But this does not mean that he may not legitimately think about these reasons, that it is outside his discretion, or that the latter reasons have somehow been displaced, preempted, or defeated, only that he would be foolish to consider them. Clearly, the person who recorded the "authoritative voice" acquires no authority by virtue of the fact that B will comply better with reasons if he treats his voiced directives as creating preemptive reasons.

I should point out, however, that as Raz usually defines the general category of "exclusionary reason," namely, as a second-order reason not to be moved by or to act for certain first-order reasons, it simply follows from the fact that it makes no sense for B to consider his reasons for staying in bed that there is indeed an exclusionary reason in this case.22 But the existence of an exclusionary reason does not guarantee that a preemptive reason of the kind Raz thinks is generated by authoritative directives exists, as Raz himself makes clear. First, a preemptive reason involves an additional new firstorder reason that preempts or displaces the excluded reasons, and that is what I am arguing is not created in this case. And second, Raz himself points out that not all exclusionary reasons are "authority-based"; some derive straightforwardly from deliberative incapacities (of the sort, indeed, that seem to be involved here).23 "Authoritybased" exclusionary reasons, Raz says, derive from "a fundamental point about authority, i.e., that it removes the decision from one person to another" (Raz 1990: 193). I take this to be a conceptual claim about practical authority, rather than, say a metaphysical claim about deliberation and action. So understood, it can be interpreted as a point about deliberative discretion, about what we may legitimately take into account.24 In this sense, however, it seems clear that no authority-based exclusionary reasons are created for B. B remains perfectly free in this sense to consider and be moved by his reasons for staying in bed. However foolish it would be for him to do so, staying in bed while considering the reasons for doing so remains within his discretion. So even if there is an exclusionary reason for B in this case, it is not the kind required to partially constitute a preemptive reason of the sort that genuinely authoritative directives create.

Suppose now that after a while the authority alarm is no longer effective for B. He no longer has a sufficiently vivid "authority experience" when it wakes him. "Oh, you're only a recorded voice," he begins to think. And he begins to talk back to the clock, saying things like "There you go again. I'm going to stay in bed. What are you going to do about it?" Being somewhat unsophisticated, the device is unable to give B a sufficiently vivid experience of being held to account. It simply continues with its

<sup>22</sup> I am indebted here to Scott Hershovitz and David Enoch. 23 See Raz 1990: 48. I am indebted here to Scott Shapiro. 24 And so, as I would analyze it, about the second-personal character of authority-based exclusionary reasons.

<span id="page-181-0"></span>recorded message: "If you don't get out of bed, you will be found in violation and made subject to the full authority of the state."

Finally, B, who really does need to get out of bed reliably at 7 a.m., is at his wits' end. In desperation, he hires an actual person to play the role of a legitimate authority. We can imagine that he hires the very person (call him A) who played the role of the authoritative experimenter in the Milgram experiment. Assume, moreover, that before he issues his directives to B, A deliberatively rehearses the reasons for and against directing B to get out of bed; as it happens A is both wise and concerned for B's welfare. This finally gives B a permanent fix to his problem; it provides B precisely the "authority experience" he needs to get him reliably out of bed at 7 a.m. When B is tempted to continue lying in bed, A speaks to B in an authoritative voice, "reminds" him of his (A's) (putative) authority and that B may not even think about remaining in bed in a sufficiently persuasive way that B "obeys."

Here again, it seems obvious that although B has reason to treat A as an authority and A's directives as giving him preemptive reasons, since this is the only way he will be able to get out of bed at 7 a.m., as he has most reason to do, A does not actually have any genuine authority over B, and A's directives do not actually create preemptive reasons. B continues to have the same weighty reasons for getting out of bed at 7 a.m., and so for responding to the directives, and the same less weighty reasons for continuing to lie in bed. Granted, he has pragmatic reasons for following A's directives (maybe even weightier reasons than he did for responding to the alarm, since, if this does not work, maybe nothing will). And so perhaps he has even weightier pragmatic reasons not even to think about the reasons in favor of continuing to lie in bed. But however weighty these pragmatic reasons might be, they do not constitute or create preemptive reasons or authority-based exclusionary reasons. Even if he would be an idiot to think for a moment of the reasons for staying in bed, it is in no way illegitimate or beyond his discretion to do so, and we have no inclination to say, as we do in the case of genuine preemptive reasons, that the reasons for remaining in bed are not just overridden, but are rather preempted or displaced.

I built into the case that A wisely considers the reasons for directing B to get out of bed in order to mirror Raz's thought that genuine practical authorities exclude reasons when they take account of them in deciding to issue directives that conflict with actions the excluded actions recommend.25 But how exactly is the fact that an

<sup>25</sup> It might be objected that Raz intends the Normal Justification Thesis only to concern the justification of claims to authority made by those who already have de facto authority; in other words, as what can turn de facto authority into de jure authority. We can easily modify the case, however, to deal with this. Suppose that A is someone with de facto authority, a policeman, say, and that the police claim the authority to enter citizens' homes and wake them up by issuing orders. Suppose that B does not, as a matter of conviction, accept the validity of these claims. Nonetheless, B needs a reliable way of getting up, and he knows that he will treat A's claims as legitimate and comply with them in his sleepy state, so B asks A to come to his house and issue orders daily at the appointed hour. It is hard to see why any of this should give B any reason to believe that A has de jure authority as a matter of actual fact. I am indebted to Candice Delmas for this objection and for discussion of it.

authority takes account of the reasons for and against the actions they prescribe supposed to be relevant to establishing practical authority (including the capacity to create preemptive reasons) according the NJT? The fact that genuine authorities have the standing to consider reasons in this way and issue directives that preclude those who are subject to their authority from legitimately taking account of the reasons in favor of actions that violate their directives is a consequence of their authority and nothing therefore that can be relevant to establishing it. Of course, one way in which the fact that a putative authority takes good account of reasons in deciding what to prescribe can be relevant to his actually having authority of one kind is in establishing his epistemic authority. But epistemic authority is not practical authority; it involves no standing to create exclusionary reasons. The most it licenses is counsel, not command.

Consider a case that Raz discusses in a recent paper. Raz notes that we "can best avoid endangering [ourselves] and others by conforming to the law regarding the dispensation and use of pharmaceutical products." In doing so we "rely on the experts whose advice [the law] reflects to know what is dangerous in these matters better than [we] can judge for [ourselves]" (Raz 2006: 114–15). The only kind of authority the experts have, however, is epistemic authority. Assume that they know better than we what we must do in order to comply with reasons in the area of their expertise. So far, the only authority they have is to issue advice—to tell us what we should or have reason to do, not to tell us to doit. Expertise alone gives them no standing to issue authoritative directives that create preemptive reasons. When we have heard their advice, we may, of course, have pragmatic reasons not just to follow it, but also not to deliberate further or even to consider reasons for acting contrary to it. But however inadvisable it might be for us to consider these latter reasons, that would not make it illegitimate or outside of our area of discretion. And it wouldn't preempt or displace the reasons.

So far as the NJT is concerned, the only work that can be done by the fact that a putative authority knows the relevant reasons for acting better than we do is to make it likelier that our treating putative directives based on that expertise as genuinely (practically) authoritative will lead us to comply better with these reasons. Raz's position is not that epistemic authority is transformed into practical authority when we would do better in complying with reasons that would apply to us if we were to accept experts' epistemic authority and follow their advice. What the NJT says is that someone acquires practical authority over us when we would do better in complying with reasons if we were to accept her "directives as authoritatively binding." It is the consequences of treating someone as having genuine practical authority that are relevant, not the consequences of seeing her as knowing better than we do what reasons for acting we have. Whether the directives are based on expertise or not has no apparent intrinsic relevance, although of course it can be extrinsically relevant in the way I described.26

<sup>26</sup> Raz might, of course, modify the NJT to require that the putative authority's directive be based on expertise, and/or that it be believed by those putatively subject to it to be based on expertise as a separate

It seems, therefore, that the most we can say when the conditions of the NJT are satisfied, is that an "alleged subject" has reason to treat the alleged authority as having genuine practical authority, and hence to regard her directives as creating preemptive reasons. As we have seen, it simply does not follow from the fact that we have reason to treat someone's directives as creating preemptive reasons that they actually do create such reasons. Even if II follows from I (in the cases considered above concerning A and B), III does not follow from II.

There being reason to treat someone as having the authority to create preemptive reasons in the fact that one will comply better with reasons in general is not therefore sufficient to make it the case that he actually has that authority. Now, as I have said, I believe that authority is conceptually tied to accountability. In my view, indeed, the capacity to create preemptive reasons is itself inextricably bound up with accountability. Once an authority sets a speed limit, it is no longer within my discretion to decide for myself whether considerations that would otherwise speak in favor of driving faster are good enough reasons for me to do so, overriding whatever reasons the law might create. I may no longer legitimately take these into account. It seems to me, however, that the reason I may not is because obeying legitimate authority is something I am answerable for doing. In this matter, I no longer simply answer to myself. I answer to the authority and, as I see it, to other representative persons or members of the moral community to whom I am accountable for complying with moral obligations.

So far, I have deliberately constructed examples where the reasons in play concern nothing we are normally answerable for doing, for example, complying with prudential reasons. And I have argued that the fact that treating someone as an authority would enable one to comply better with these reasons cannot establish that he actually has the authority one would thereby take him to have. It cannot establish that his directives create preemptive reasons. If one is not answerable for providing for one's retirement or for getting out of bed at 7 a.m., then, even if one would do better at accomplishing these (and so complying with the relevant reasons) were one to treat oneself as answerable to some authority and so treat his directives as creating preemptive reasons, one does not thereby actually become answerable to him, and his directives do not thereby create preemptive reasons.

But what if the reasons themselves concern moral obligations, which, if I am right, are things we are answerable (to one another as representative persons or members of the moral community) for doing? If we restrict the NJT to reasons that already entail answerability in some form, will it serve to justify differential practical authority claims of the sort Raz is concerned with, e.g., of someone A over someone else, B, along with A's capacity to create preemptive reasons for B? I do not think so.

Suppose that the reason why B needs to get out of bed at 7 a.m. is that if he does not he will be unable to comply with an important obligation, say, a promise he has made

condition. But this would raise the question of the relation of this new condition to the (unmodified) NJT, since it would seem to have a substantially different rationale from the NJT as Raz has proposed it.

to C. And suppose that the only way B can reliably get out of bed at 7 a.m. is to treat A as a legitimate authority in the way we earlier imagined. Does this create some special accountability of B to A? Does it make it the case that A has the capacity to create preemptive reasons for B? Now, as I analyze things, in having promised to C, and thereby given C a right and created an obligation to C, B has become answerable to C in a special way as a right holder.27 Only C is in a position to release B from his promise, to receive an apology or compensation should B not keep his promise, and so on. However, in being morally obligated period, B is not distinctively answerable to C; he is accountable to the moral community and, in principle, therefore, to anyone as a representative of the moral community, including A, C, and B himself.

Notice now that none of this involves any special accountability of B to A or A's having any special capacity to create preemptive reasons for B. B is no less answerable to A than to any other member of the moral community, but neither is he any more. We might agree that if the only way B can keep his promise to C is to treat A as having authority over him and regarding himself as answerable to A, then he is, as we might then put it, answerable for answering to A. He would not, however, be especially answerable to A for answering to A. Any special or individual answerability would seem to be to C. Under these conditions, he would be answerable to C, especially, for answering to A, as the only means for complying with his obligation to C. B would also be answerable to the moral community, and hence, inter alia to A, for answering to A. But this is not the same kind of accountability to A that would be involved in A's having authority over B.

Neither, it seems, would A thereby acquire any capacity to create preemptive reasons. We should agree with Raz that mandatory moral norms create preemptive reasons, and therefore, that if it would be wrong for B not to get out of bed at 7 a.m., that B has an exclusionary reason not to consider or act on any reasons he might otherwise have to stay in bed (Raz 1990: 61). If it is wrong for him to stay in bed, then it is no longer legitimate for B to consider staying in bed for the reasons that would otherwise recommend his doing so; this is no longer within his discretion. Similarly, if C were to object to B's remaining in bed, then C's legitimate demand owing to the right given him by B's promise would create a preemptive or authority-based exclusionary reason for B. But none of this gives A any distinctive authority to create preemptive reasons for B that other members of the moral community do not have.

As I see it, what explains the capacity of mandatory moral norms to create (authoritybased) exclusionary reasons is that they are tied to accountability in the way I have proposed. It is because we are answerable to one another for not violating moral obligations that it is not within our discretion to deliberate on the basis of reasons that would otherwise recommend actions that, as things actually stand, amount to moral wrong. Here we answer not just to ourselves but also to one another and, indeed,

<sup>27</sup> I discuss promising as a second-personal relation in Darwall 2011b.

<span id="page-185-0"></span>ourselves, as representatives of the moral community. But if that is right, then the capacity to create exclusionary reasons cannot characterize a concept of authority that is an alternativeto authority as involving accountability. Rather the capacity to create exclusionary reasons would itself derive from an accountability relation that is itself essential to practical authority.

But if the NJT fails therefore both for authority as accountability and, consequently, for authority as the capacity to create preemptive reasons, what then can justify differential authority relations, as in legal and political authority? The lesson to draw from the failure of the NJT, I believe, is that the only justification that can succeed is one that proceeds from within the second-person standpoint, beginning with the assumption that we all share a common basic authority to make claims and demands of one another at all, and proceeding from there to consider what differential claims to authority anyone could sensibly accept, or no one could reasonably reject on that basis. The basic premise underlying any successful justification of differential authority, in other words, is that we share a common basic authority to make claims of each other just by virtue of being persons. Or, as Rawls put the point, to be a person is to be a "self-originating source of valid claims" (Rawls 1980: 546).28

## 10. Law and the Second-Person Standpoint

In SPS, I argue that there is a distinctive kind of a reason for acting, a second-personal reason, that is conceptually implicated in many central moral notions: moral responsibility, moral obligation, rights, respect for and the dignity of persons, and the concept of moral agent or person itself. What is distinctive about second-personal reasons is that they are analytically related to claims and demands that an addresser has the authority to make of, and address to, the agent second-personally. Because this is so, I argue, reasons of this kind always involve an accountability relation between addresser and addressee, that is, that the addressee is answerable to the addresser in some way, if not for compliance, then at least to give consideration or something similar.

Although the claims I argue for in my book concern morality—moral obligation, responsibility, rights, and so on—they would seem also to bear on the law. 1 One way of viewing my project, in fact, is as trying to bring out the distinctive character of that part of morality that is modeled on the idea of law.2 Moral obligations, I argue, are not just what there are good (or even compelling) moral reasons for us to do; they are what morality demands of us and what we are accountable for doing, where the latter is understood as what representative persons or members of the moral community have the authority to demand that we do. This is why, like Kant, we naturally speak of the "moral law" in such cases.

Similarly, moral rights must also be understood in legal or juridical terms. What a person has a moral claim right to is what she has the standing as an individual to demand that others provide her, along with the authority to hold them accountable for doing so. What she has a moral liberty right to do is what others have no authority to demand that she not do. And so on. Moral rights thus also involve the moral law. If I have a moral liberty to do A, then I do no wrong in doing A, that is, I do nothing that members of the moral community have, as such, the authority to demand I not do. I do not violate the moral law, understood as what members can demand of one another. And if I have a moral claim, as an individual, to your doing A, then the moral law gives me special standing as an individual to demand that you do A and to hold you

<sup>1</sup> For a more systematic development of this idea, see Kar 2011. 2 See "Morality's Distinctiveness" in this volume.

<span id="page-187-0"></span>accountable if you do not, say, to demand that you compensate my injury or to release you from compensation or, even, to forgive you for injuring me. This is a standing I have not as a representative of the moral community authorized to hold one another responsible for moral wrongs in general, but as an individual involved in the transaction. It involves, not my representative authority, which is in play with moral obligations period, but an individual authority I have as the person to whom a (bipolar) obligation is owed, that is, as the obligee (Darwall 2012).

The authority that is involved in moral obligations and rights are forms of moral authority, as I see it, the authority of members of the moral community to make claims and demands of one another as such. But the notions of authority, obligations, rights, and responsibility are also all obviously central to law properly so-called (that is, to laws legislated, administered, and enforced by those with legal authority). Laws create legal obligations and rights, and the authority to hold responsible is essential both to the criminal and the civil law. Laws are not simply standards that assess conduct in some specific way; laws are promulgated, that is addressed, to those who are subject to them, and they make putatively authoritative demands with which addressed subjects are responsible for complying.

Legal sanctions are not just coercive threats, even justified ones. They involve an exercise of putatively legitimate authority that purports to give reasons for compliance that cannot be reduced to the desire to avoid some evil in which the sanction consists, or even to avoid a justified evil. As Hart famously put it, laws purport to obligate rather than only to oblige (Hart 1961: 6–8). However unwelcome or restrictive sanctions may be, there is a fundamental conceptual difference between putting someone on notice of a legitimate sanction as a way of holding him responsible for complying with law and coercion, even, as Raz has pointed out, justified coercion. Unlike justified coercion, the exercise of authority invariably involves "an appeal for compliance" and "an invocation of the duty to obey" (Raz 1986: 25–6). We respect law not in the same way a fighter might respect his opponent's left jab; we recognize its authority.

As I see it, the reasons that the law purports to provide are second-personal reasons. I cannot defend this proposal in detail here, but in what follows I nonetheless want to suggest some reasons in its favor and for thinking that the notions of second-personal address and of what I call second-personal authority and second-personal competence can be useful in understanding the nature of law and legal obligation. First, however, let me say something about the notions of second-personal reason, authority, and responsibility or accountability that I will be employing in my analysis and that I explore at greater length in The Second-Person Standpoint.

#### Second-Personal Reasons

The intuitive idea of second-personal reasons can be gotten across with an example. Suppose someone has stepped on your foot. Compare, to begin with, two different ways in which you might try to give him reason to get off.

<span id="page-188-0"></span>One would simply be to get him to see that you are in pain, that this is a bad thing, or, at any rate, bad for you, and that either fact is a reason for him to remove his foot. Nothing in the existence of this reason, or even, indeed, in your being able to get him to see and accept it, need have anything to do with second-personal address, that is, with your having any authority or standing to make any particular claims on him.

A different way of giving someone a reason to move his foot from yours would be to lay a claim or address a purportedly valid demand. "Hey, that's my foot," you might say, implying a right to determine where your foot steps and who may and who may not step on it. Your implicit demand would presuppose a discretionary individual authority that right holders have to exercise their wills, to make demands, to consent to what would otherwise violate their rights, to seek compensation for violations of their rights, and so on. I say "discretionary" because you could consent to his foot placement.

Or suppose you are a third-party bystander to a foot tromping, and say something like, "Hey, you can't just step anywhere you like. You're stepping on someone's foot, and that's wrong." Here again, you would be pressing a claim or demand against the person, and assuming some authority to do so, but not, this time, as the right holder. Rather (I argue), you would be presupposing an authority we all have as representative persons or members of the moral community (Darwall 2006).

Both of these latter two reasons, that someone is violating one's right, or that an action is morally wrong (period), are second-personal reasons in the sense that both depend conceptually on second-personal address. The idea is not that the reasons must actually be addressed in order to exist. You have a right that others not step on your feet without your consent, whether you say anything to them about this or not. And the moral wrongness of stepping unbidden on other people's feet depends in no way on anyone's actually demanding that people not do this. The idea is that the concept of a right and the concept of moral obligation implicate second-personal address. It is entailed by the very idea of a claim right that right holders have a distinctive (individual) authority to demand certain treatment and hold those who violate their rights personally accountable at their discretion (Feinberg 1980).

I argue that the idea of moral obligation similarly entails accountability, in this case, to any representative person or member of the moral community. What we are morally obligated to do, what it is wrong not to do, is not just what there are good, or even conclusive, moral reasons for us to do. It is what we are morally accountable for doing in the sense that failing so to act, without excuse, is morally blameworthy. Blame is what Strawson called a "reactive attitude" (Strawson 1968). It is an attitude with a distinctive "inter-personal" or second-personal structure, since it implicitly makes a demand of (and so implicitly addresses a demand to) its object.3 Unlike other critical attitudes—such as disesteem, disdain, and disgust—blame involves a second-personal

<sup>3</sup> I bring out these aspects of Strawson's analysis in Darwall 2006.

<span id="page-189-0"></span>orientation toward its object that contrasts with a third-personal or, what Strawson calls, an "objective attitude." Unlike other critical attitudes, reactive attitudes bid for reciprocal recognition of the authority they presuppose. They come with an RSVP.

I therefore argue that the concepts of moral rights and of moral obligation, and so moral right and wrong, are second-personal concepts. Therefore reasons that are expressed with these (and related concepts) are second-personal reasons. Unlike the first reason for acting, which depends in no way on second-personal address, reasons of the second kind would simply not exist without the possibility their being addressed second personally.

The notion of a second-personal reason is one of a set of irreducibly second-person concepts that can be defined in terms of one another. Practical authority legitimates claims and demands that the person having it can make of someone who is subject to her authority and hold him accountable for. Someone is accountable to someone else just in case the latter has the authority to make claims and demands of the former. A valid claim or demand on someone is one that another person has the practical authority to make. And a second-personal reason is any reason deriving from a valid claim or demand.

Again, I argue that the concepts of moral responsibility, moral obligations, rights, respect for and the dignity of persons, and the concept of person or moral agent all involve these irreducibly second-personal notions. As I see it, this is a fact of the first importance for moral theory. It means that no premises not involving these secondpersonal notions can entail any conclusion that does. It follows that substantive theses about moral obligation or right cannot be convincingly supported simply from premises about how it would be desirable for the world to be. This doesn't rule out utilitarian or consequentialist moral theories, to be sure, but it does mean that for them to be adequately supported, they will have to be advanced within a secondpersonal framework, that is, from within a set of assumptions about our authority to make claims and demands of one another at all.4

#### Law and Legal Authority

I turn now to ways in which the framework of second-personal ideas I have been sketching might help illuminate the character of law. To begin with, note that nothing I have said about the four interconnected, irreducibly second-personal notions just discussed ties them exclusively to morality. As I see it, the root idea here is of secondpersonal normative reasons, which reasons always presuppose authoritative claims and demands, hence authority, along with accountability. As I analyze them, secondpersonal reasons are grounded in genuine, that is de jure, authority of any kind. Moral obligations derive from the equal authority of representative persons or

<sup>4</sup> As I see it, some such argument lies behind the attraction of preference-satisfaction forms of utilitarianism. The idea that people's preferences are relevant to social choice is more naturally grounded in the idea that everyone has fundamentally the same claim than it is in ideas of general happiness of welfare.

<span id="page-190-0"></span>members of the moral community to hold one another morally responsible; obligations within, say, a military chain of command, derive from the authority to issue orders of various kind; and so on. So also, I propose, do legal obligations and responsibilities derive from legal authority.

Now I do not want to take any stand on fundamental issues of jurisprudence that divide legal positivists and their critics, at least those in the mainstream. Whether the existence of law depends on anything ethical or genuinely normative, and how law relates to morality, can remain in dispute even if all parties agree that there is a conceptual difference between law and straightforward coercion or the "gunman writ large." At the very least, all sides can accept that the law presents itself as having de jure authority, whether it actually has it or not. Or as we might alternatively put the point, in order for law to exist there must be some authority de facto, and in order for de facto authority to exist, at least some people, maybe just a critical mass of public officials, must be seen to treat some practices or institutions as having authority de jure (and maybe, as Hart held, must actually so treat them by taking an "internal point of view") (Hart 1961: 55–7).

Something analogous is true of morality, actually. Even skeptics like Hume's "sensible knave" or Hobbes's "fool" can question whether morality creates genuine normative reasons while agreeing that it purports to do so (Hobbes 1994: XV.4; Hume 1985: 283). So they can accept my analysis of moral obligation and distinguish between the putative existence of second-personal reasons and whether such normative reasons exist in fact. They can, if they like, use "moral obligation" and "moral reason" to refer to the former, that is, to the putative normative reasons that they deny are normative reasons in fact. If they do, they can agree that morality creates "moral obligations" and "moral reasons" for action, but deny that these are genuinely obligating or genuine normative reasons. In so doing, they would deny that the putative authority that morality claims is authority de jure. (They may even deny that this is such a thing as de jure authority.) My suggestion is that the same is true of legal authority and the law. The law presents its demands as issuing from genuine, that is, de jure authority, but this may not be so in fact.

I take it, then, that the concept of law requires that of legal authority, that is, not just authority that is created as a social fact, as when a law is passed that gives some body the authority to issue a permit to ride bicycles within the city limits, but also the authority to make or find law itself, that is, to make it the case that citizens have legal obligations, responsibilities, and reasons at all that they otherwise would not have had. If this is so, the concept of law would seem to be a second-personal concept, that is, one that can only be defined within the set of interdefinable irreducibly second-personal concepts that I outlined in the last section.

There is, then, a truistic or tautological sense in which the concept of law is second personal. By definition, if you like, laws derive from legal authority and create legal obligations, responsibilities, and reasons to comply, that is, "legal obligations" and "legal reasons" for acting in a sense analogous to that in which even a moral skeptic can <span id="page-191-0"></span>accept that there are "moral obligations" and "moral reasons." Second-personal legal reasons exist in this sense, whether or not such reasons are genuinely normative and whether or not the authority that law and legal authority purport to have is de jure. This much is tautologous or nearly so. Whether or not the relevant reasons, obligations, responsibilities, and authority are genuinely normative or de jure or not, it should be clear that they have a facially second-personal structure. The concept of legal obligation seems analytically to entail those of legal responsibility, authority, and reasons. What one is legally obligated to do is what it is one's legal responsibility to do, what one has a legal reason to do, and what legal authority requires or demands that one do. And similarly with the other interdefinable legal concepts. Legal reasons of the appropriate kind just are those that are associated with legal obligations and responsibilities, that is, with what is demanded of us by legal authority. And so on.

Thus legal concepts are at least superficially second personal. Whether or not the law creates genuinely normative second-personal reasons, obligations, and responsibilities, the putative reasons and obligations are nonetheless second personal in their structure. They are situated within a framework of putative authority and accountability relations. They purport not simply to favor action, or even to provide compelling or conclusive reasons for it, but to give distinctive reasons that derive from authoritative demands, hence bear conceptually on what we can legitimately be held responsible for doing. And this points to a second way in which law may be second personal, namely, that the putative second-personal reasons and obligations may actually exist. The reasons that law purports to create are genuine second-personal reasons, that is normative reasons for acting that derive from some genuine, that is, de jure authority to make demands and hold responsible.

Now if the argument of SPS is correct, the only way any such authority can be established is within the second-person perspective. But how can any such authority claim be justified? I argue that one thing that distinguishes second-personal reasons from reasons for acting of other kinds is that the validity of second-personal reasons depends upon its being the case that the person to whom they apply can be expected to accept the reasons and the authority from which they derive by exercising the capacities in virtue of which the reasons apply to him. The root ideas are, first, that second-personal reasons always presuppose an accountability relation, second, that certain capacities (second-personal competence, as I call it) are necessary to be able intelligibly to be held responsible at all, and, third, that when we hold someone responsible for doing something, we are committed to thinking that the person we hold responsible is capable of holding himself responsible by recognizing and acting on the relevant reason (along with the requisite authority) through exercising the relevant capacities.

Compare the difference in what you must presuppose about someone to believe that there are, say, reasons of prudence for her to do something, or even to give prudential advice to her, on the one hand, and what you must assume to hold someone responsible for complying with some putatively authoritative demand, on the other. You may sensibly think that it would be for my good for me to take my medications, say, and <span id="page-192-0"></span>therefore that there is a prudential reason for me to do so, without supposing anything about my having any ability to accept and act on this reason. Even in giving me advice to act for this reason, you do not have to think that this is something I must be able to be brought to see the wisdom of for myself. You might just say, "Trust me, this really is a good reason to do this and you should do it." After all, whether the reason exists just depends on whether it would be for my good so to act, not on whether I can be brought to see this. If, however, you address a putatively authoritative demand to someone to get off your foot and hold him answerable for doing so, you do assume, do you not, that this is something he should be able to see for himself, or at least to appreciate when it is pointed out to him? After all, how can you hold him responsible for doing something for reasons he cannot himself appreciate even when they are pointed out to him? To intelligibly hold someone else responsible at all, it seems, you have to suppose that he is capable of holding himself responsible, that is, that he can comply with the demand by recognizing the authority to make it and that he is therefore responsible for compliance.

If this is right, then second-personal reasons must satisfy a "reasonable acceptance" condition.5 Unlike reasons for acting of other kinds, their very existence is staked on its being the case that those to whom they apply can reasonably be expected to accept their validity by accepting the authority from which they derive. But what authority can we reasonably expect people to accept? In SPS, I argue that when someone takes up a second-person standpoint toward someone and make claims and demands of her of any kind, he is committed to the presupposition that both he and his addressee share a common second-personal authority to make claims and demands of one another at all by virtue of their capacity to enter into relations of mutual accountability (that is, their second-personal competence).

It follows from what we have said already that the addressee of a second-personal reason must be assumed to have the authority to hold himself responsible through making the relevant demand of himself. This is not a trivial thing. Holding someone responsible for doing something is trusting and respecting her, by giving her authority to answer for her conduct, including to herself as well. Of course, this may involve the application of a sanction. But a sanction through which we hold someone responsible is not just a penalty or cost, and the second-personal authority and reasons that it takes to justify sanctions in the right way, that is, as a way of holding responsible, differ from reasons of other kinds that might be sufficient to warrant imposing costs. To be a reason of the right kind, a consideration must be something the sanctioned agent could reasonably be expected to accept as making the sanction legitimate, that is as consistent with the respective authorities of addresser and addressee, and hence as fully respecting the addressee's authority also.

<sup>5</sup> For related discussion, see Yaffe 2008.

<span id="page-193-0"></span>The point can be made with an example drawn from SPS. If a sergeant orders a private to do ten pushups, she addresses a reason to him that presupposes her authority to give the order and the private's obligation to obey it. So far, she may assume only a superior authority, that as a sergeant she has the standing to give orders to the private, whereas the private has no standing to give orders to the sergeant. But an order does not simply point to a reason holding in normative space; it purports to address it second-personally, press the claim or demand, and hold the addressee responsible for compliance. As second-personal address, an order presupposes that its addressee can freely determine himself through accepting the reasons it addresses and the authority on which they are grounded and hold himself responsible for complying with it. Any second-personal address whatsoever calls for reciprocal recognition of the authority it presupposes (in this case the sergeant's authority). It attempts to direct an addressee's will through the addressee's own free acceptance of that authority.

In assuming that the private is responsible for complying with the order, the sergeant is committed to thinking that the private would rightly be blamed if he failed to comply without adequate excuse. But attitudes like blame address demands from a perspective they presuppose their addressee can share (Strawson 1968). Their content is not just "I blame you," but "You are to blame (as you should be able to see and acknowledge yourself )." So although the sergeant assumes she has a distinctive authority to hold the private accountable, which goes with her special authority to issue the order in the first place, any such specially authorized standing must ultimately be grounded in an authority she must assume that the private shares with her (to hold himself accountable). Otherwise, threatening a sanction, even one he could not complain about, would give him a reason of the wrong kind to comply. The reason would not be a second-personal reason to do the pushups whether or not he could escape the sanction, one the acceptance of which is part of holding himself responsible.

In making a claim on the private in this way, consequently, the sergeant must presuppose a distinction between making a legitimate claim on the private's will in a way that respects his authority as free and rational, on the one hand, and, on the other, attempting illegitimately to direct his will by simply imposing her will on him coercively. However hierarchical, therefore, any address of a second-personal reason also implicitly presupposes a common second-personal authority as free and rational.

The upshot, I believe, is that any de jure authority must be able to be justified to those over whom it is claimed in a way that is consistent with the equal second-personal authority of all persons, that is, all second-personally competent rational agents. I argue that this basic proposition can provide a grounding of the right kind for contractualist moral theories of the sort advanced by Scanlon (1998) and suggested by Rawls ("rightness as fairness") in A Theory of Justice (1971). I conjecture that the proposition can also ground similar approaches to justifying political and legal authority. De jure authority of these kinds is also irreducibly second personal and must, consequently, be capable of being justified to those subject to it in ways that are consistent with their <span id="page-194-0"></span>(equal) second-personal authority. I turn now to ways in which the criminal and civil law more specifically illustrate this claim.

#### Criminal Law and Second-Personal Reasons

Broadly speaking, the criminal law is that part of the law where legal punishment is appropriate. But how should we conceive of punishment? It is a familiar idea that punishment essentially involves holding someone responsible for something she has done based on a finding of culpability and guilt. Of course, a legal system may articulate these latter ideas in formal ways with specific standards. But that does not change the fact that the underlying ideas have the same basic (second-personal) shape as those connected to moral obligation, namely, moral responsibility, culpability, and guilt. The moral emotion of guilt is the feeling that one has failed to respect some moral demand, that one is rightly blamed and held responsible; indeed, feeling guilt is itself part of holding oneself responsible. And guilt's natural expressions are second personal also acknowledgment of fault, apology, making amends, and so on—through which one makes oneself answerable, acknowledging the authority to hold one responsible and, therefore, to make claims and demands of one in the first place.

Although apology is most appropriately to the victim, acknowledging his distinctive authority to determine whether or not to forgive the wrong, and so on, guilt is not the feeling that he alone has a justifiable complaint. One does not blame oneself as if from the victim's standpoint. One sees oneself as being to blame, that is, that blame is appropriate from a common perspective that violator and victim share as representative persons or members of the moral community. In other words, one feels that punishment and not just compensation is warranted. (Compare, in this regard, Locke's distinction between the right of compensation that victims of injustice have in the state of nature, and the right of punishment, which is held by everyone (Locke 1988).) And in so feeling, one acknowledges, and thereby respects, the moral community's authority to hold one responsible.

As I see it, viewing legal punishment in terms of accountability can also provide a more adequate conception than typical retributivist or consequentialist approaches. The problem with purely consequentialist accounts of punishment put simply in terms of the desirability of deterrence or defense is the same one Strawson identified with consequentialist approaches to moral responsibility: they do not provide a reason of "the right sort" for practices of moral responsibility "as we understand them" (1968: 72, 74). That we have reason to desire to be able to hold people responsible for something is one thing, whereas our having reasons of the right kind that warrant our legitimately doing so, that is, that give us the authority to do so, is another. The only reasons that can justify relating toward someone in some way as an instance of holding him responsible are second-personal reasons; facts concerning the desirability of likely outcomes of the action are, taken by themselves, simply reasons of the wrong kind. This does not mean, of course, that consequences cannot figure within second-personal reasons.

<span id="page-195-0"></span>But consequentialist approaches are not the only ones that fail to honor Strawson's point. That some response to a wrong might make for a more fitting whole does not itself establish any authority so to respond. If punishment is, in its nature, holding someone responsible for violations of law, then the right kind of justification for it must be one that can establish its legitimacy; the reasons must be ones the punished can reasonably be expected to accept concerning what can be expected (by anyone, himself included) of himself. Violations of law are, at bottom, failures of respect, most obviously of legal authority, but also of the de jure authority (as I see it, residing in the community of second-personally competent persons) that all legal authority purports to have.

Punishment can be justified in the right way, therefore, only by being called for by the underlying mutual respect that mutual accountability itself involves. This is a crucial difference between the form that respect takes in an honor culture and in one built around the idea of mutual accountability (Darwall forthcoming b). Punishment is not a form of retaliation or vengeance that annuls a dishonoring insult or injury and restores the victim's status while lowering that of his victimizer (Darwall 2010b). It does not return disrespect for disrespect. If and when it is justified by considerations that are rooted in equal second-personal authority, punishment respectfully expresses a demand for respect. Adam Smith writes that when we resent injuries, what our resentment is "chiefly intent upon, is not so much to make our enemy feel pain in his turn, as . . . to make him sensible that the person whom he injured did not deserve to be treated in that manner" (Smith 1982: 95–6). Properly justified, therefore, a specific form of punishment is called for as a warranted way of holding someone responsible. By accepting punishment, someone thereby recognizes the authority to be held responsible and to have made the relevant demand in the first place; one thereby takes responsibility for oneself.

To view punishment in this way is to see it as justifiable in fundamentally secondpersonal terms. It follows that if appropriateness of punishment is distinctive of the criminal law, then criminal law is best viewed in fundamentally second-personal terms also.

#### Civil Law and Second-Personal Reasons

Aspects of the civil law seem to have a fundamentally second-personal character also (in addition to the general second-personal grounding that, if I am right, any genuine de jure authority has, and therefore, any putative authority must purport to have). Take, for example, the law of torts. Torts are violations of (bipolar) duties to individuals or, equivalently, rights obligees hold against the obligor (Darwall 2012). They involve injuries of various kinds that we have duties to others not to visit on them, whether intentionally or through negligence. Of course, these same actions may be proscribed by the criminal law also, but whereas what is at issue in criminal punishment is, as we have just seen, a form of holding responsible that is carried out by duly constituted legal <span id="page-196-0"></span>authorities (in the name of the moral community from whom they inherit their authority), what is involved in torts is compensation, that is, something the victim has a distinctive right to claim or not at his discretion. No one else has the authority to bring an action in tort, and if the victim would prefer not to, then that is usually the end of it. It is, of course, central to the idea of a society under the rule of law that victims do not have standing to "take the law into their own hands" and hold others accountable in ways they might be legally entitled to as a result of due process. They must proceed through appropriate legal channels, through the courts. Nonetheless, the law gives expression to their distinctive authority to claim such compensation as the right holder. The very idea of torts involves the standing individuals have to themselves decide whether to pursue or waive claims to compensation.

In my view, an influential theory of torts, "civil recourse theory," advanced by John Goldberg and Benjamin Zipursky, is best interpreted in second-personal terms, namely that tort law gives expression to our individual authority to hold those who violate our rights accountable to us (Goldberg 2006, 2009; Zipursky 2003, 2008; Goldberg and Zipursky 2010). What civil recourse theory gets right, in opposition to its competitors, is its focus on the victim's individual authority. However, defenders of the theory sometimes present their view as legitimating retaliation, "vengeance," or "action against" victimizers by victims (Zipursky 2003: 749–50). But as I see it, a secondpersonal approach can show that tort actions should be seen as expressing a kind of mutual respect that is actually incompatible with retaliation and vengeance.6 The latter notions, I have argued, invoke a notion of respect that is more at home in honor cultures—where dishonoring, status-lowering disrespect can be annulled by reciprocating disrespect (e.g., revenge) (Darwall forthcoming b and 2010b). In "accountability cultures," disrespect calls for attitudes and treatment that respectfully demand respect.

#### Conclusion

These remarks about the criminal and civil law and about the putative authority of law in general have been necessarily sketchy. I hope, however, that they have at least indicated some ways in which the framework of ideas that I present in SPS might prove helpful in accounting for a number of phenomena concerning the law, including legal authority, obligation, responsibility, and, perhaps, the nature of law itself.

## 11. Civil Recourse as Mutual Accountability(co-authored with Julian Darwall)

In SPS and a number of papers since, I have attempted to work out a theory of moral obligations as involving mutual accountability between equals, where the latter, I argue, is irreducibly second personal, since it entails an equal authority we have to address claims and demands to one another and ourselves (Darwall 2006, 2010a, 2010b, 2012).1 As many writers have pointed out, moral obligations concern the part of morality that is modeled conceptually on legal, or as Sidgwick called them, "quasi-jural," concepts of responsibility and authoritative demands and claims (e.g., Sidgwick 1967: 196; Anscombe 1998). What we are morally obligated to do is not just what morality recommends or what there is good, weighty, or perhaps even conclusive reason to do from the moral point of view. It is what morality requires. It is what is legitimately demanded of us as moral agents or persons, just as legal obligations concern what the law demands of citizens subject to it. Illegal and wrongful actions are violations of what the law and the moral law, respectively, mandate or require.

Similarly, both moral and legal obligations conceptually entail distinctive forms of responsibility, or accountability. What we are morally obligated to do is what we are responsible or accountable for doing, just as legal obligations entail legal responsibilities. I argue that moral responsibility is irreducibly second personal since it entails accountability or answerability, and that these are always, as a conceptual matter, to someone with the authority to hold us thus answerable (even if that person is we ourselves). When it comes to morality, theological voluntarists, like the early modern natural law theorists Pufendorf and Locke, hold that the moral law implicates our accountability to God. My theory is that moral obligations concern our accountability to one another and ourselves as equal moral persons or members of the moral community.

<sup>1</sup> This article is a collaborative attempt by the authors to say something about how the second-personal framework developed in Darwall 2006 and more recent papers, e.g., Darwall 2012, might apply to tort law and, more specifically, to civil recourse theory. In what follows, the authorial "I," "my," etc., will refer to Stephen Darwall, and the authorial "we," etc., will refer to both co-authors of this article, Julian Darwall and Stephen Darwall. "You," will refer to you, dear reader, and "we," used non-authorially, will have its usual presumptive sense, referring to you, the authors, and indeterminate others. We regret any confusion; perhaps, however, presuming on your pronominal sensitivity is appropriate in a paper about "second-personal" matters.

<span id="page-198-0"></span>The idea of answerability is no less implicated in our idea of law, pure and simple. Criminal proceedings seem, by their very nature, to involve answering charges, defense, determinations of culpability, mitigation, excuses, and holding the guilty accountable through criminal punishment. Similarly, proceedings in civil or private law, including torts, involve a form of answerability, although one that is importantly different from that involved in criminal cases. Complaints are brought not by the state on behalf of the community as a whole but by individual plaintiffs, who claim to have been injured by the violation of a legal obligation or duty to them. In civil proceedings, defendants are required to respond to such complaints, and courts attempt to establish the justice of the complaint, and, if justified, whether compensation of some sort is owed by the defendant to the victim.

In some recent papers, I suggest that the form of authority and accountability that underpins civil or private law is different from that at the root of criminal law, and that this legal distinction tracks a moral distinction between, respectively, obligations that are owed to others, so called "relational," "directed," or "bipolar" obligations, and moral obligations, pure and simple, or as I sometimes call them, moral obligations period (Darwall 2007b, 2012a; see also Thompson 2004). As a moral philosopher, I have mainly been interested to point to differences between civil and criminal law that I take to be uncontroversial among legal philosophers—that civil cases are appropriately brought by plaintiffs and that criminal cases are brought by "the people" and their representatives in order to illustrate by analogy differences that I have been arguing exist in morality between relational or bipolar moral obligations and moral obligations period.

Here, however, we want to say something about how the second-personal framework I have been developing might apply to tort law, particularly, to an important and influential theory of torts: the civil recourse theory that has been worked out in the writings of John Goldberg and Benjamin Zipursky. In our view, civil recourse theory captures an important truth about the structure of relational or bipolar legal obligations, which we take to be the kind that are normally involved in torts, namely, that injured victims of violated bipolar obligations owed to them have a distinctive standing to hold their injurers responsible that neither third parties, nor the community at large, have. I have called the analogous moral standing, individual authority. This is an authority that, distinctively, obligees (that is, individuals to whom bipolar moral obligations are owed, or correlatively, claim right holders) have to hold obligors accountable to them individually. This authority is individual, moreover, in the further sense that it is discretionary; it is distinctively up to the individual who has the authority whether or not to exercise it. For example, a victimized obligee has a distinctive individual authority to decide whether to complain or to seek an apology or to forgive a deadbeat obligor, or, indeed, to pursue any combination of these; she can exercise this authority at her discretion. We believe that the distinctive moral standing that is involved in being owed a bipolar moral obligation and having a correlative claim right against an obligor are de jure analogues of (de facto) bipolar legal obligations and claim rights that are in play in tort law and that the former plausibly underpin the latter.

<span id="page-199-0"></span>By contrast, the authority that is implicated in moral obligation period (and, by analogy, in the criminal law) is no individual's authority, but something we have as representative persons or members of the moral (or legal) community. I argue in Darwall 2006 that we presuppose such an authority when we hold one another and ourselves accountable for unexcused moral wrongs, for example, through what P. F. Strawson called "reactive attitudes," such as indignation, moral blame, and self-blaming attitudes like guilt (Strawson 1968). We do not presuppose any such authority as the particular individuals we are, or as having any particular relation to the wrongdoer. We presuppose it rather as representative persons or members of the moral community. Nor is this authority discretionary. When we feel blame toward and thereby imaginatively address a putatively valid demand to someone, we, as it were, "second" or "give voice" to a legitimate demand that we take to be authorized from the third-party (not to say, "third-person"—more on this later) perspective of a representative person.

We shall therefore argue that what civil recourse theory gets right is the distinctive individual authority that victims have to hold their victimizing obligors accountable to them. However, defenders of the civil recourse theory sometimes present their view as legitimating retaliation, "vengeance," or "action against" victimizers by victims. Here we shall suggest that an understanding of true mutual accountability between obligees and obligors—correlatively, between claim right holders and those they hold rights against—shows this to be mistaken. To realize genuine mutual accountability between equals, tort actions should be seen as expressing a kind of mutual respect that is actually incompatible with retaliation and vengeance. The latter notions, I have argued, invoke a notion of respect that is more at home in honor cultures—where dishonoring, statuslowering disrespect can be annulled by reciprocating disrespect (e.g., revenge) (Darwall forthcoming b and 2010c). In "accountability cultures," as I have called them, disrespect calls for attitudes and treatment that respectfully demand respect.

As we see it, the idea of justified retaliation is not really central to civil recourse theory, and, to be fair, Goldberg and Zipursky's allusions to it seem off-hand and noncommittal. The present article might therefore best be seen as an argument for developing civil recourse in one way rather than another, that is, within a framework of mutual accountability rather than legitimate reprisal. In addition, we suggest a tentative account of tort remedy and process within that framework

#### Bipolar Obligations and Moral Obligation Period

We shall begin by saying something about how the ideas of moral obligation period and bipolar or relational moral obligations or duties differ conceptually. Here we assume that the kind of relational duties we are concerned with are not merely conventional or even legal, but moral in the sense that violation of a bipolar obligation to someone wrongs that person, other things being equal at least.

On a second-personal analysis, both moral obligations period and bipolar obligations involve legitimate demands and so presuppose an authority to make the demand and <span id="page-200-0"></span>hold the person who is subject to the obligation accountable. What distinguishes the two is the different authorities they respectively presuppose.

To see moral obligation period's conceptual tie to legitimate demand consider the idea of morally supererogatory action. The concept of a supererogatory act is that of an act that morality recommends but does not require, an act that, as it is said, "is above and beyond the call of duty." Such an act might be thought to be one that it would be morally good for the agent to do but nonetheless one that the agent is not morally obligated or required to do, say, because it involves a level of sacrifice that cannot be legitimately demanded of him or her. Now notice that whether there are any supererogatory actions, whether this concept is actually instantiated, is a substantive normative issue and therefore a conceptually open question. Some normative ethical theories—for example, act consequentialism—hold that there can be no such thing. On an act consequentialist theory of right, moral agents are always under a moral obligation to do whatever morality would most recommend they do—by consequentialism's lights, to perform that action, of those available to them, that would produce the best consequences overall. But act consequentialism is a substantive normative theory, not a conceptual analysis. No normative theory, neither act consequentialism nor any other, could hold that supererogation is conceptually impossible.

If a critic claims act consequentialism to be "too demanding" and a consequentialist denies this, they must employ the same concept of moral obligation to disagree. The consequentialist must agree that the possibility of supererogation is conceptually open, even if she denies as a normative thesis that there is any such thing. She must agree that her critic is not being self-contradictory or conceptually confused when she denies consequentialism because it denies the (normative) possibility of supererogatory action.

The space between the concepts of moral recommendation, however weighty, and moral obligation is explained by the latter's (but not the former's) conceptual tie to legitimate demand and accountability. Any discussion of whether consequentialism is "too demanding" a moral theory assumes, as we all normally do, that what is morally obligatory is what morality demands, that is, what we are legitimately held accountable for as moral agents.

SPS follows a number of philosophers, including John Stuart Mill, Richard Brandt, and Allan Gibbard, in arguing that the concepts of moral obligation, duty, right, and wrong are tied to those of legitimate demand, accountability, and therefore conceptually to moral blame (Mill 1998: Ch. V; Brandt 1979: 163–76; Gibbard 1990: 41). What is morally obligatory is not just what there are good moral reasons to do, however weighty these reasons might be. It is what it would be morally wrong not to do. And a moral wrong is not just any kind of failing, but what it would be blameworthy to do, were one to do it without excuse.2 As Mill put it, "There are other things . . . which we

<sup>2</sup> Note that the concepts of moral wrong and of violation of moral obligation are nonetheless distinct from that of blameworthiness. Something is morally wrong, violates a moral obligation, if, and only if, it would be blameworthy if done without excuse. Excuses defeat claims of blameworthiness, but not that of having done

<span id="page-201-0"></span>wish that people should do, which we like or admire them for doing, perhaps dislike or despise them for not doing, but yet admit that they are not bound to do" (Mill 1998: Ch. V. }14). In these cases, Mill adds that "it is not a case of moral obligation; we do not blame them."3 It is a conceptual truth that an act is morally wrong, if, and only if, it is blameworthy if done without excuse.

Blame, as it functions in this line of thought, is not a speech act, but a Strawsonian reactive attitude. When we blame someone in speech, indeed, we normally intend to express, and to be taken by our interlocutor to express, the distinctive attitude of blame. SPS follows Strawson in arguing that reactive attitudes have a special role in mediating human practices of responsibility—more precisely, accountability or answerability—because they are essentially "inter-personal," as Strawson put it, or "second personal," in the terms of Darwall 2006.4 They implicitly address demands to their objects in a way that other critical attitudes like disdain or contempt need not. And they presuppose an authority to address the demand and bid for the other's recognition of that authority. They have an implicit RSVP.

Strawson did not give a formal definition of reactive attitudes, but their central features are clear from the role they play in his argument about moral responsibility and freedom of the will. Strawson's core idea is that reactive attitudes involve a characteristic "inter-personal" way of regarding the individuals who are their objects that commits the holder of the attitude to certain assumptions about the object individual and her capacities to regulate her will. Unlike "objective attitudes," such as disdain, disgust, and annoyance, reactive attitudes are essentially characterized by "involvement or participation with others in inter-personal human relationships" (Strawson 1968). There is always a second-personal element to reactive attitudes. Through the attitude we hold its object to something and thereby implicitly make a demand of (and so implicitly address the demand to) him or her. As Strawson put it, "the making of the demand is the proneness to such attitudes" (Strawson 1968: 92–3). The reason that reactive attitudes distinctively implicate freedom of the will, then, is that we can intelligibly address a demand to someone to regulate her will appropriately only if we suppose that she can so regulate it as a result of recognizing our demand's legitimacy. That supposition is, as Gary Watson says, a "constrain[t] on moral address" (Watson 1987: 263, 264). In this way, reactive attitudes like moral blame are unlike other critical attitudes, such as disesteem, contempt, and disgust, which lack an intrinsically addressing, second-personal element, whether these latter take a distinctively moral form, as in moral disesteem or disgust, or not.

moral wrong. To the contrary, an excuse itself presupposes that the conduct it excuses was nonetheless wrong.

<sup>3</sup> Also: "We do not call anything wrong, unless we mean to imply that a person ought to be punished in some way or other for doing it; if not by law, by the opinion of his fellow creatures; if not by opinion, by the reproaches of his own conscience" (Mill 1998: Ch. V.}14). 4 See also Watson 1987 and 1996.

<span id="page-202-0"></span>Strawson makes a distinction, which is important to our argument, between personal and impersonal reactive attitudes. A personal reactive attitude, like resentment, is felt as if from the perspective of an involved party (like the victim in a tort), while an impersonal reactive attitude is felt as if from an uninvolved, third party's standpoint. It is, however, crucial to Strawson's argument, as it is to that of Darwall 2006 and to our argument here, that both personal and impersonal reactive attitudes are essentially "inter-personal" in Strawson's sense (or "second personal" in ours), since both implicitly address demands. Thus "first-party" reactive attitudes, like guilt, second-party attitudes, like resentment, and third-party attitudes, like indignation or moral blame are all equally "inter-personal" or second personal.5 "Second person" does not mean "second party." Reactive attitudes, whether personal or impersonal, are all equally second personal in having implicit addressees. As Strawson puts it, they are all equally "participant" as opposed to "objective" attitudes, such as annoyance, disesteem, or disgust.

If moral obligations period are what it would be blameworthy to fail to do without excuse, and if blame is an impersonal reactive attitude that implicitly makes a demand, then both obligation and blame presuppose the idea of a standing or authority that any third party, or as we might put it, any representative person or member of the moral community, has to hold wrongdoers responsible and implicitly address the demand to them. I formulate this point by saying that each and every one of us has a representative authority to address the moral demands we implicitly make of ourselves and one another, as we presuppose when we feel blame (Darwall 2010a, 2010b, 2012b).6

I argue that bipolar moral obligations, that is, directed duties whose violation entails that the violating obligor has injured and, at least other things equal, wronged his obligee, also conceptually entail an authority to address claims and demands. However, the kind of authority distinctive of bipolar obligations is not representative authority but an individual authority that the individual obligee has to make claims and demands of an obligor who is obligated to him and to hold the obligor personally accountable. To be sure, violations of bipolar obligations not only wrong the obligee; they are also wrong period, at least, other things being equal.7 And this entails, on a second-personal analysis, that third parties have a representative authority to hold the wrongdoer accountable as well. But third parties do not have the distinctive individual authority that the victim has, and which, moreover, he may exercise at his discretion.

As Hohfeld famously pointed out, bipolar obligations entail correlative claim rights and vice versa (Hohfeld 1923: 65–75). If X is obligated to Y to do A, then Y has a right against X that X do A. I follow Joel Feinberg in maintaining that claim rights

<sup>5</sup> The first two are personal reactive attitudes; the third is an impersonal reactive attitude. 6 Note that no authority to express this attitude publicly follows straightway. What standing anyone has to do that I take to be a substantive normative, rather than a conceptual, matter. 7 That is, unless the obligor has a justification for the violation. In this case, the action is no longer wrong,

even if there remains a compensable injury. We take it to be a semantic choice whether or not to say that the obligee is "wronged" in this case. We can follow Jules Coleman and say that in such cases the entailed claim right (and bipolar obligation) are "infringed" rather than "violated" (Coleman 1992: 301).

<span id="page-203-0"></span>conceptually implicate a distinctive standing (individual authority) to claim that to which they are entitled (Feinberg 1980). It follows that bipolar obligations essentially involve this distinctive second-personal authority also.8

We can easily imagine a society (Feinberg's "Nowheresville") in which it is thought morally wrong (period) to step on others' feet, unless, say, they desire or do not mind one's doing so, but where the latter is not seen as a giving of consent, which can only be understood within a framework of bipolar obligations and claim rights. Consent, by definition, is required for actions that would otherwise wrong the person who gives it. In Nowheresville, others' will and preference appear simply as features of the moral landscape that bear on moral obligations period. Others are not regarded as having any prerogative, normative power, or authority to consent, where consent is conceived as something that can be given only through a second-personal address that reciprocally presupposes the individual authority to release one from what would otherwise be a bipolar obligation to the other.

Consent in this sense can only be given second personally, and it implicates bipolar obligations and claim rights by definition (Ripstein 2009: 111–32; Darwall 2012b). It is an exercise of a normative power, in this case, to release someone from a bipolar obligation he would otherwise have had, say, not to step on your feet (Raz 1972 and 2002: 98–104). Normative powers, in general, are authorities or standings to enter into reciprocally recognizing second-personal engagements with others that alter bipolar obligations and claim rights between the parties, but that also presuppose that the parties are already obligated to one another in various ways. Other essentially bipolar normative powers include the authority to make promises, to enter into agreements and contracts, and even to exercise such prosaic normative capacities as simply asking someone to do something or acceding to a request (Watson 2009; Darwall 2012b; Enoch 2011).

The power of consent is but one of an ensemble of individual normative powers or authorities that enter into the having of a claim right against someone, and therefore into another's having a bipolar obligation to one. Moreover, these powers or authorities are all essentially second personal. Feinberg emphasizes that the right holder's authority to demand or claim her rights enters into the very idea that she has a claim right. "[I]t is claiming," Feinberg writes, "that gives rights their special moral significance" (Feinberg 1980: 151). The authority to claim our rights "enables us to 'stand up like men,' to look others in the eye, and to feel in some fundamental way the equal of anyone" (Feinberg 1980: 151). When we regard persons as having a claim right that others not step unbidden on their feet, part of what we think is that each person has a distinctive set of individual authorities over others' conduct with respect to his feet that he does not have with respect to the treatment of other people's feet. And these powers include the individual authority to hold the person against whom the right is held

<sup>8</sup> The next several paragraphs draw heavily from "Bipolar Obligation."

<span id="page-204-0"></span>personally accountable. If the right is violated, the right holder has an authority or standing that others do not have to decide whether or not to complain, seek apology or compensation, or to forgive.

Right holders have a distinctive authority to hold others answerable for violations of their rights that third parties do not have. The point is not that third parties have no authority. To the contrary, I argue that the individual authorities that right-holding obligees have can exist only if obligees share a representative authority with third parties, as well as with any obligor who might violate their rights. The point is that there is a special individual authority an obligee has to hold the obligor personally answerable that can, like the power of consent, be exercised only by the right-holding obligee herself at her discretion.

One way to see this is to reflect on forgiveness (see, e.g., Griswold 2007). Just as it is uniquely up to the right holder to decide whether or not to consent or to waive her right (assuming the right is waivable), so is it distinctively up to a victim whose right has been violated whether to forgive someone who has violated it. No one else has the same authority or standing.9 Moreover, just as the power to consent can exist only against the background of bipolar obligations and rights that are in force without consent, so also can the authority to forgive exist only against the background of a distinctive authority that obligees and right holders have to hold their obligors personally responsible. Forgiveness involves the victim's somehow moving past personal reactive attitudes, like resentment, that mediate personal responsibility (Butler 1900: Sermon IX, "Upon Resentment and the Forgiveness of Injuries").

The situation is similar with apology. An apology is, by definition, addressed to someone who receives it and who has the authority to accept it or not. If a victim comes upon an unaddressed admission of guilt and expression of sincere regret in her victimizer's diary, she has not discovered an apology.10 Apologies are a way of holding oneself personally answerable to an obligee whose authority to hold one thus answerable is thereby reciprocally recognized. It is a second-personal acknowledgment of having violated a bipolar obligation to the obligee and of the obligee's special authority to hold one answerable for it.

On a Strawsonian analysis, impersonal or "third-party" reactive attitudes through which we hold ourselves and others accountable, and presuppose the representative authority to do so, are implicated in the concept of moral obligation period. A moral obligation (period) is what it would be blameworthy not to do, were one to fail to perform without excuse. Similarly, personal reactive attitudes are implicated in the concept of a directed duty or bipolar obligation. A bipolar obligation exists where failure to perform would warrant the obligee in resenting the obligor.

<sup>9</sup> Though others who are specially related to the victim may have some standing, it is nonetheless not the same. 10 Though she might if she came across something with the same content addressed to her.

<span id="page-205-0"></span>To summarize, moral obligations period and bipolar moral obligations involve different authorities to address their demands and hold obligated subjects answerable for compliance. Bipolar obligations of the sort underpinning the legal obligations in play in tort law involve, as part of their conceptual structure, an individual authority that obligees have to hold obligors personally accountable to them.

#### Civil Recourse, Corrective Justice, and Individual Authority

We turn now to tort law and to civil recourse theory as a theory of torts. To this point, we have been considering conceptual claims about moral obligation period and bipolar moral obligations, including arguments that these concepts respectively involve distinctive forms of authority, representative and individual authority, respectively, and distinctive forms of accountability. Torts involve violations of bipolar legal obligations, not moral ones. But though the legal obligations that torts violate are not themselves moral or even necessarily de jure in some broader non-moral sense, they arguably nonetheless purport to have de jure force, as even legal positivists can allow. If this is so, and if, as we submit, the arguments of SPS apply to de jure obligation and authority more generally and not just to morality more narrowly conceived, it will follow that torts must purport to involve a distinctive form of accountability that is analogous to that involved in bipolar moral obligations and claim rights, namely, a distinctive accountability of tortfeasors to their victims. We believe that civil recourse theory can give theoretical expression to this fact, though we shall suggest that it can do so adequately only if it is developed in a way that stresses the mutual accountability of tortfeasor and victim.

Civil recourse theory seeks to reframe the theory of torts in a fundamental way. As Goldberg and Zipursky see it, torts came in the last century to be viewed primarily in terms of the fair or efficient allocation of costs, an idea whose root they find in Holmes, and in later writers like Prosser and law and economics theorists like Calabresi. Civil recourse theory reframes tort as a law of private wrongs and recourse. Tort law defines duties to refrain from injuring others, duties that are directed or bipolar in the sense that they are owed to others. When these duties are breached by an action, that action constitutes a wrong to the obligee; it wrongs him. An action that breaches a right protected by tort law therefore provides a legal basis for private recourse by the obligee against the obligor in court—a private right of action, through which a plaintiff may attempt to exact damages or relief from an injurer.

Now it might seem that corrective justice theories had already offered a substantially similar reaction to views concerned primarily with loss allocation. These theories, developed by Jules Coleman, Stephen Perry, Arthur Ripstein, Ernest Weinrib, and others, take as their wellspring a principle of corrective justice that holds that tortfeasors acquire a duty to repair the wrongful losses that their conduct causes. Coleman's <span id="page-206-0"></span>version, in particular, has understood tort law as embodying both first- and secondorder duties: first-order duties not to injure and second-order duties of repair (Coleman 1992: 317). When conduct breaches a relevant first-order duty and causes injury, the principle of corrective justice triggers a second-order duty of repair.

For a loss to be wrongful in the sense of requiring repair from the point of view of corrective justice, the wrongdoer need not be blameworthy. Indeed, the tortfeasor need not even be a genuine wrongdoer in the sense of having done something wrong, all things considered. A person can be wronged in the sense of being made subject to a wrongful loss even by actions that are morally permissible or perhaps even praiseworthy. Coleman writes:

Culpability is not a condition of a wronging. . . . Indeed, in the case of some wronging, the injurer's conduct is actually morally praiseworthy or, at least, permissible. . . .Wronging can sometimes create wrongful losses even in cases of justifiable conduct. In cases of wronging, neither the absence of blame nor the presence of praiseworthiness is sufficient to defeat a claim that a loss is wrongful. The wrongfulness of the loss derives from the fact that the conduct is . . . invasive of a right. (Coleman 1992: 335)11

The tortfeasor's act need only have fallen below a legal standard of conduct established by the duty not to injure. The tort of negligence, for example, imposes liability on those who injure by conduct that falls below a standard of due care: the conduct of a "reasonable person of ordinary prudence." Coleman emphasizes that people are often not blameworthy for falling below this standard but are nonetheless liable in tort. The sense of "wrong" and "wronging" that is relevant to Coleman's corrective justice theory is simply that of an infringement of the victim's right not to be injured, which is correlative to the wrongdoer's first-order duty not to injure. Breaches of this first-order duty trigger a duty to repair the injury caused by the breach, regardless of whether the tortfeasor's conduct was culpable or perhaps even morally justifiable.

The significance of corrective justice theory, according to Goldberg and Zipursky, is that even if it takes a wronging of a victim to trigger the duty of repair, what matters for the theory is the tortfeasor's duty to repair the victim's loss (Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 925–7). They distinguish corrective justice theories, all animated by the duty to repair a loss, from their own civil recourse view, according to which tort remedy is driven by the defendant's responsibility for having committed a wrong against the plaintiff "in a manner that renders her a victim entitled to respond to the wrongdoer" (Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 944).

Goldberg and Zipursky stress Coleman's insistence that tort law is fundamentally about losses, not about wrongdoing. "Tort law is about messes. A mess has been made, and the only question before the court is who is to clean it up?" (Coleman 1998: 257, 302). If tort

<sup>11</sup> Without the ellipsis: "The wrongfulness of the loss derives from the fact that the conduct is a wrong, and the conduct is a wrong because it is invasive of a right." Our elliptical construction is designed to set up the contrast Goldberg and Zipursky wish to draw. Note also, as mentioned in note 6 above that Coleman calls justified breaches of bipolar obligations "infringements" or "invasions" of the entailed claim right.

<span id="page-207-0"></span>were a state response to wrongs, Coleman and Perry argue, the state would offer legal remedy or penalty based on the gravity of the wrong, rather than awarding plaintiff damages typically keyed to the losses caused by a wrong (Coleman 1992; Perry 2000).

Goldberg and Zipursky thus align corrective justice theory with "loss allocating" views that are concerned fundamentally with a just distribution of resources to remedy losses. What makes the civil recourse view distinctive, in their view, is that it offers a relational account of tort as a law of redress for wrongs, which they claim better fits fundamental features of tort doctrine. According to Zipursky, "The key to tort liability . . . is that plaintiffs have rights to act against defendants, not that defendants have prior legal duties of repair to plaintiffs" (Zipursky 2008: 110). For civil recourse theory, the point is not that tort defendants have a duty, but that they have a tort liability. As Zipursky puts it, "Liability is not best explained as a form of duty to those whom one has wronged, but rather as a form of vulnerability to the one who has been wronged" (Zipursky 2008: 110). Tort law concerns the sorts of conduct our legal system defines as wrongfully injurious in the sense that, when committed, "the victim is entitled to exact something from the wrongdoer" (Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 919).12

What do Goldberg and Zipursky mean by a right to "exact something?" Their accounts have evolved and continue to do so. We hope that the present article will contribute to this progression. Goldberg and Zipursky have portrayed the power to exact remedy within the context of what they call a Lockean or "social-contract" view. On this picture, citizens relinquish the liberty to respond aggressively to a wrong and receive in return from the state a certain level of security against responsive aggression by others and additional assurance that a civil avenue of redress against wrongdoers will be supplied (Zipursky 2003: 735; Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 974). The state is therefore obliged to provide plaintiffs with an avenue of recourse through which they are empowered to act against their victimizers. The private right of action is the state's civil empowerment of individuals who have been wronged against the wrongdoer.

The state recognizes itself as obliged to empower the plaintiff to act in some manner against the defendant and acts on that obligation by permitting the plaintiff to exact damages or have the defendant enjoined against performing certain acts. (Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 974)

Zipursky notes also that the existence of punitive damages suggests that tort law "permit[s] the plaintiff to 'be punitive,' or to 'be vindictive'—to inflict hardship upon the defendant out of resentment, spite, orthe desire for revenge, not necessarily as an aspect

<sup>12</sup> Goldberg and Zipursky's contrast with corrective justice may seem somewhat exaggerated. They acknowledge that Coleman calls tortious "infringements" of victim's rights "wrongs." After all, they note, Coleman's influential book is titled Risks and Wrongs (Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 925). Still, they claim that tort law, for Coleman, as for Perry, does not respond to wrongs as wrongs even in Coleman's defined sense. It responds to the wrongfully created injury or loss, which the tortfeasor has a duty to repair. For civil recourse theory, by contrast, the tortfeasor does not so much acquire a duty as incur a liability, consisting in victim's right of recourse, her entitlement "to exact something from the wrongdoer" (Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 919).

<span id="page-208-0"></span>of self-restoration" (Zipursky 2003: 751).13 In a similar vein, Goldberg says that the civil recourse theory's "animating ideas . . . are relational and retaliatory, involving notions of empowerment, response, and satisfaction" (Goldberg 2006: 435–6).

Presently we shall argue that justified retaliation or vindication is not the most promising way of developing civil recourse theory's fundamental insights. We think civil recourse theory is right to stress tort liability as a distinctive "vulnerability" that tortfeasors have to their victims (Zipursky 2008: 110). However, we think it is a mistake to conceive this vulnerability in terms of susceptibility to vindication, vengeance, or retaliation, ideas that are more appropriate to an honor culture or ancient Greek tragedy and myth than to the law of torts (or, indeed, to the criminal law). As we see it, the vulnerability that characterizes torts is a form of accountability or answerability of the same genus as the one involved in bipolar moral obligations. Private law, and the law of torts more specifically, involve the fundamental idea that individuals have obligations to and rights against one another and that each person has an individual authority to hold others answerable for complying with obligations to him and his rights against them, just as others have the same authority to hold him answerable for complying with his obligations to them and their rights against him. Goldberg and Zipursky might well agree with this point. "Even when a particular tort is not also a moral wrong," they write, "saying that it is a legal wrong is similar to saying that it is a moral wrong in at least the following respects: it asserts that the act in question . . . merits some form of accountability when done" (Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 950). And even more to the current point: "Individuals who are able to prove that someone has treated them in a manner that the legal system counts as a relational, injurious wrong shall have the authority to hold the wrongdoer accountable to him" (Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 974).14

Goldberg and Zipursky offer a number of reasons to think that the doctrine of tort better fits their view than corrective justice. We focus here on the fact that tort doctrine gives a distinctive right to the injured individual to seek tort remedy, which we suggest is the legal expression of a conceptual point about the normative structure of bipolar obligations and claim rights more generally, namely, that obligees have an individual authority and consequently a distinctive standing as victims to hold their obligors responsible for violating obligations held to them.

In "Civil Recourse and Separation of Wrongs and Remedies," Arthur Ripstein argues that a Kantian corrective justice of the kind he holds can also explain why it is that only victims have standing to bring a case in torts (Ripstein 2012).15 However,

<sup>13</sup> "It may simply reflect the principle that a plaintiff who has been willfully wronged is entitled to be

punitive in this manner, if he or she so chooses" (Zipursky 2003: 751). 14 "A morally significant aspect of what an actor has done is whether his acts—described in a resultinclusive way—are ones that another person could fairly demand that he be held accountable for" (Goldberg and Zipursky 2010: 944). 15 It seems to us that Coleman's version might also do the same, along the following lines. It is important

that the first-order duty not to injure is bipolar, since it entails the correlative claim right (of obligees) not to be injured. And so also is the duty to repair an injury to a wronged victim bipolar, since it entails the victim's right to have her injury repaired. If, however, Darwall 2012 is right that bipolar obligations and claim rights

while Ripstein's argument establishes that a Kantian account like his can explain victims' distinctive standing to bring tort actions, we believe that it nonetheless falls short of providing a view on which a defendant can be seen to be accountable to a plaintiff; nor, indeed, can it explain a genuinely bipolar obligation of the wrongdoer to the wronged individual.

Ripstein also rejects Goldberg and Zipursky's claim that corrective justice cannot view tort as a law of wrongs. Ripstein builds his argument on a Kantian theory of right, according to which each person has an "innate right of humanity" to pursue whatever ends he or she chooses independently of the choices of others and consistently with others' equal right (Ripstein 2009: 30–56). Since pursuing ends is impossible without some means or other, every person must be presumed to have some means by right most clearly, his own body, but also external things he can rightfully acquire as property (Ripstein 2009: 57–109). Individuals are wronged when others take their means or otherwise infringe on their rights to them. According to Ripstein, tort law remedies wrongs, conceived as violations of such rights, by restoring the means to which individuals have a right (Ripstein 2012: 7).

The Kantian doctrine of right flows, again, from the idea that individuals have the right to use their means to pursue whatever ends they adopt, independently of the choices of others and consistently with others' equal right. From the point of view of tort law, an individual's means are her bodily powers and mental capacities, her reputation, and her property. These individual entitlements taken together create a system of rights through which each is his own master and independent of others.

It is important to Ripstein that the victim's original right to her means continues to exist even if someone takes her means from her in violation of her right (and so wrongs her). She remains entitled to the use of her means even after another person has taken them. The duty of repair that is the cornerstone of corrective justice theories of tort is, according to Ripstein's Kantian theory, just the tortfeasor's duty to restore to someone any means to which she has a right. A remedy simply restores to the wronged individual that to which she is already entitled; it replaces the deprived means to which an individual continues to have a right after the wrong. Ripstein's version of corrective justice conceives of right and remedy as continuous, in that an individual's primary right to her means is the same right for which she claims restoration in demanding remedy. The right to remedy is no different from the primary right to her means.

Having set out his Kantian version, Ripstein's response to Goldberg and Zipursky's charge that corrective justice theory cannot explain why the law of tort gives only an injured person a private right of action is then simple. A right constrains the conduct of

conceptually implicate the individual authority of obligees (claim right holders) to hold obligors (those against whom obligees' claim rights are held) answerable for compliance, then victims' distinctive standing to hold their victimizers accountable follows directly from that. And this can explain within a Colemanian corrective justice theory why only victims have standing to bring cases in torts.

<span id="page-210-0"></span>others, but only the bearer of the right can determine whether to exercise it. Only the injured victim has a right to her means against interference from others. And so only the injured victim has a right to claim the restoration of her means when she is deprived of them. It follows from this analysis that a tort suit must be initiated by a plaintiff simply because a plaintiff is the only one with standing to exercise any right that she has. The law of tort may not afford a plaintiff distinctive standing in the civil recourse sense, but it uniquely affords a plaintiff a private right of action since a plaintiff alone is entitled to determine the purposes for which her means are used.Where she does not claim restoration of means after a deprivation, she effectively allows another the use of her means.

We cannot pursue the matter fully here, but we believe that although Ripstein's Kantian theory of right can explain victims' distinctive standing to bring tort actions, it cannot explain any distinctive accountability tortfeasors have to victims, nor indeed, any genuinely bipolar obligations owed to their victims in the first place. The point concerns not Kantian theories in a broad sense, but theories, like Ripstein's, that are based on Kant's theory of right. And it derives from the fact of what, according to Kant, a right most fundamentally is. For Kant, a claim right to something is an "authorization" to use coercion in defending or securing that thing (Kant 1996c: 390 (Ak. 6: 230)). As Ripstein puts it, Kant identifies a right as a "title to coerce" (Ripstein 2009: 30). Violations of a right are, Kant says, "hindrances," and since a right is an entitlement to the use of coercion to protect that to which one has a right, Kant holds that it follows from the very idea of right that the hindering of hindrances is itself rightful (Kant 1996c: 526 (Ak. 6: 396)).16

If a right is a justification to coerce, then tort law is the mechanism through which victims can rightfully coerce tortfeasors to provide them with the means to which they had a right in the first place, or with its nearest replacement. Our point, however, is that this entails no accountability of the tortfeasor to the victim. In fact, it does not entail any accountability to anyone. It just means that tortfeasors cannot complain if their victim recovers her means, whether by a tort suit or in some other way, just as they could not have complained if she had used force to prevent the tort in the first place.

Would not, however, some kind of accountability flow from the obligations that follow from the original rights that justify victims' tort action? Not necessarily. The sense in which rights "constrain" conduct, on a Kantian view of right, is not that they entail moral constraints in the sense of genuinely bipolar obligations to victims that the tortfeasor's tortious conduct violates. The only moral constraint that follows from rights, conceived as justifications for coercion, is that right holders are justified in constraining violations of their rights.

<sup>16</sup> Kant begins the section of The Doctrine of Right titled "The Supreme Principle of the Doctrine of Right Was Analytic": "It is clear in accordance with the principle of contradiction that, if external constraint checks the hindering of outer freedom in accordance with universal laws (and is thus a hindering of hindrances to freedom), it can coexist with ends as such" (Kant 1996c: 526 (Ak. 6:396)).

<span id="page-211-0"></span>This is a fundamentally different picture from the view that claim rights entail that the person against whom the right is held is obligated, and therefore accountable, to the right holder not to violate her right. No distinctive accountability to the victim is entailed; indeed, no accountability to anyone whatsoever is entailed. We could even say that, on the Kantian theory of right, the fact that one has a right against someone is not itself a moral reason of any kind for that person to accord one what one can claim from him by right. Of course, there may, and most usually will, be reasons that a Kantian moral theory will credit that will explain why someone should not violate the right. The point is that the fact that a person has a right is not itself such a reason—that is simply the fact that the right holder will be justified in constraining the person against whom the right is held not to violate the right.

We believe that civil recourse theory has a potentially better account of victims' distinctive standing to bring a suit in torts. To theorize adequately both the original rights and bipolar obligations with which tort law is concerned and the distinctive standing that tort law gives to victims, it is essential, in our view, to appreciate the way the concept of accountability enters into both. Claim rights and bipolar obligations are, as a conceptual matter, what obligors are accountable to obligees (right holders) for doing, and the law of torts provides an appropriate legal expression of this fundamental idea.

In this respect, civil private law in general, and torts, in particular, are to bipolar obligations as the criminal law is to moral obligation period. Just as representative third parties or the moral community have the authority to hold wrongdoers responsible through accountability-seeking reactive attitudes, so is it appropriately up to the people's representatives to decide whether to bring a criminal action. Even whether to prosecute a rights violation is not uniquely up to the victim. But if the issue is civil rather than criminal responsibility, then since this concerns the obligee's individual authority rather than community members' representative authority, obligees really should have special legal standing.

In recognizing the distinctive individual authority of victims, a civil recourse theory of torts is supported by a conception of mutual accountability that is grounded in the second-person standpoint. At the same time, however, Goldberg and Zipursky sometimes present civil recourse theory in terms of "vindication" and "revenge," as we noted above. So we would like to say more about why we think this is a mistake and to suggest that the idea of the mutual accountability of equals can provide a more promising alternative.

At one point Goldberg places a more agonistic interpretation of civil recourse theory within an ideal of equal respect. "Part of the state's treating individuals with respect and respecting their equality with others," he says, "consists of its being committed to empowering them to act against others who have wronged them" (Goldberg 2009: 974). It is important, however, to distinguish two fundamentally different conceptions of (recognition) respect for persons that relate to fundamentally different conceptions <span id="page-212-0"></span>of the person and that mediate different conceptions of social order.17 One is the idea of respect for one another as mutually accountable equals—second-personal respect. And the other is the form of recognition respect that mediates a status hierarchy of honor honor respect. Vindication, retaliation, and revenge are responses to disrespect within an order of honor. Dishonoring disrespect (contempt) seeks to lower its victim's status, and when it is unopposed, it effectively does so. The victim's status can only be restored by retaliation against the dishonorer, which avenges the insult. The response to disrespect is a reciprocating disrespect.

The sense of "person" in play in an honor culture is that of persona, an individual's social presentation or "face." Someone has a certain status, or occupies a social role, when others respect his person (persona) in the sense of allowing him the social role he wishes by playing along with him as supporting actors in a social drama. When, however, they treat his self-presentation with contempt, his persona is no longer supported, and he loses face. The emotional response to contempt is shame, whose natural expression is to cover one's face and hide, to remove oneself (even if only) imaginatively from view.

Even if the ideas of retaliation and vengeance are most at home within a hierarchical status culture, that is not, of course, what Goldberg and Zipursky are proposing. They see the state, through tort law, as "respecting [victims'] equality with others." Nonetheless, the way the state would be doing so would still be within the conceptual framework of an honor culture, by providing victims the opportunity to restore their status by avenging their dishonoring wrong.

Consider in this connection a similar proposal that Jean Hampton made about how to conceive of punishment of rights violations. Those who violate others' rights presume a kind of authority over others. They act toward their victims as though their victims have lesser value. They arrogate a kind of "lordship" over their victims and seek to establish this by making their victims submit to the indignity involved in their crime (Hampton 1998b: 124). According to Hampton, the "retributive idea" is that the appropriate response to such attempted diminishment and "defeat" of the victim is to turn tables and force the wrongdoer's "submission," thereby defeating him and reconfirming or "vindicating" the victim's value. According to Hampton, punishment involves a public humiliation of the arrogant violator that simultaneously brings him down a peg and restores his victim's status or honor.

We might think of Hampton's proposal as the analogue in criminal law of a vengeance interpretation of civil recourse theory in tort law. The point of the tort proceeding is not for the state to humiliate the rights violator, and thereby restore the equal status of criminal and victim, but to provide a public forum in which the victim can do so. In our view, however, this imports the idea of equality into a conceptual structure that is still fundamentally that of an honor culture.18 Respect for one another

<sup>17</sup> We draw here on Darwall forthcoming b. 18 Other writers who make a similar move are Waldron 2009 and Appiah 2010.

<span id="page-213-0"></span>as mutually accountable equals is a different idea, not just in the sense that honor cultures are generally hierarchical, but because respect in this latter sense is essentially second personal and reciprocal in a way that honor respect even between equally honored equals need not be (Darwall 2006: 119–47).

To respect someone as a mutually accountable equal is to hold oneself answerable to him at the same time one holds him answerable to oneself. It is to be in secondpersonal relation to someone. Respect for persons in this sense is what Strawson calls a "participant's" attitude, an attitude of "involvement or participation with others in inter-personal human relationships" (Strawson 1968). Honor respect and contempt, by contrast, even honor respect for equals or peers, are third personal; they are "observer's" or "objective" attitudes in Strawson's sense. Contempt towards someone, for example, is not necessarily implicitly expressed to that person; it is more characteristically expressed to peers who are invited to join in the contemptuous attitude.

When someone in a community of mutually accountable equals violates an obligation, whether an obligation period or a bipolar obligation, she does not thereby become a legitimate object of contempt. To the contrary, she is held accountable for her violation. And this reciprocating response is no form of disrespect that seeks to lower her status or retaliate. It is rather a reactive attitude like moral blame that implicitly seeks to engage the other second personally and demand respect. Because the attitude is essentially interpersonal or second personal, it views another in a way that recognizes him as a mutually accountable equal. As Strawson puts the point, reactive attitudes continue to "view [someone] as a member of the moral community; only as one who has offended against its demands" (Strawson 1968: 93). They demand respect in a way that is itself respectful, at least implicitly.

It is a reflection of this that the "first-party" attitude that responds to (indeed, reciprocates) second- or third-party reactive attitudes is not shame, but guilt. Guilt is the feeling as if being appropriately charged (second personally) with some violation, and its natural expression is also second personal—the desire to acknowledge guilt and take responsibility. That is partly what it is to hold oneself answerable.

When we hold one another answerable, whether for wrongdoing period, as representative members of the moral community, or for wronging us individually, as the individual victim to whom the injurer is bound by a bipolar obligation, we enter into a relation of reciprocal recognition and mutual respect for one another as mutually accountable equals. Holding someone answerable thus precisely does not return disrespect for disrespect; it embodies a respectful demand for respect.

If we project these ideas into the law of torts, it would seem that for the legal system to "trea[t] individuals with respect and respec[t] their equality with others," would not be for it, in Goldberg's words, to "empowe[r] them to act against others who have wronged them." Rather, the legal system would enable individuals to hold their <span id="page-214-0"></span>victimizers answerable by respectfully demanding respect. Only in this way, we believe, can tort law genuinely express an ideal of mutual accountability.19

#### Tort Remedy, Perspective, and the Community

Having emphasized the role of mutual accountability in civil recourse, our account of tort process and remedy calls for clarification. A tort suit not only is an attempt to exact remedy from a defendant, but also serves to hold a defendant accountable in a characteristic way—according to legal standards that have general application to a community of mutually accountable equals. Thus, although a plaintiff bringing a claim based on her individual authority advocates her own position, her prayer for tort relief is at bottom a call to initiate a legal process that seeks mutual recognition of the rights of each party.

In the course of this judicial process, courts apply norms and directives established for the whole society to individual cases, settling disputes through the application of those norms (Waldron 2010b: 10). Courts accomplish this with hearings structured to enable impartial determination of the rights and responsibilities of particular persons on the basis of evidence and argument from each party. When presented, evidence is made available to be examined and confronted by an opposing party in open court, and each party has the opportunity to answer publicly the arguments of the opposing party on the record. In making and interpreting arguments in court, lawyers and judges conceive of the law as a whole, attempting to discern and articulate coherence by integrating particular propositions into a systematic legal structure. Parties and their representatives frame legal arguments within this integrated system, inviting judges and juries to consider how their position fits into a coherent conception that has general application to the community (Waldron 2010b: 17). The parties' arguments are tailored, of course, to their individual situations and commitments. As Waldron points out, part of the law's respecting individuals is that it treats them as though they "had a view or perspective of their own to present on the application of the norm to their conduct and situation" (Waldron 2010b: 14).

Even so, a tort claim is not simply a demand from the plaintiff 's perspective in what Waldron has called a "lobbying sense"; it does not merely say what the law should be from only the plaintiff 's point of view. Rather, civil suits allow the parties to influence the court's deliberation about what that law is, such that all members of the community should be held accountable to its requirements. To be sure, a plaintiff asks the court to adopt her arguments, but in order to prevail, these must be offered in a way that is susceptible of general public application to a community of mutually accountable

<sup>19</sup> In Solomon 2009, Jason Solomon argues that at an ideal of equal accountability grounded in the second-person standpoint can support a civil recourse theory of victims being given legal standing to demand respect of their victimizers by "acting against" them. As we see it, however, equal accountability is always implicitly mutual, recognizing the equal standing of all to demand respect.

<span id="page-215-0"></span>equals. Thus, in a suit arising from a plaintiff 's individual authority, a judgment is imposed from a more general perspective.20

Focusing on this feature of tort as mutual accountability further illuminates the way in which the institution supports, as others have argued, social equality and the dignity of persons. Waldron and Seana Shiffrin have both recently argued that reasonableness standards, which undergird a significant amount of tort law, respect the dignity of each party in part because they embody this particular conception of persons as capable of holding themselves accountable to each other (Waldron 2010a, 2010b; Shiffrin 2010). Applying reasonableness standards to individual conduct "embodies a crucial dignitarian idea—[that] those to whom the norms are applied [are] beings capable of explaining themselves" (Waldron 2010b: 14). The application of legal standards to individual conduct conceives of citizens as capable of apprehending the rationales by which the law governs them and of relating standards to their view of the relation between their actions and purposes and those of the community.21 Shiffrin further reminds us that rather than requiring application of a rule by rote, reasonableness standards induce deliberation among citizens, requiring that they ask themselves, for example, whether they are taking due care, behaving reasonably, or treating one another fairly (Shiffrin 2010: 1217). This is itself an exercise in mutual accountability. Reasonableness standards make possible "richer forms of moral and democratic relations," and require individuals to actively apprehend and appreciate others' rights (Shiffrin 2010: 1222–5).22

Tom Tyler's experimental studies show that tort victims seek, not compensation pure and simple, but to hold tortfeasors accountable through fair procedures that enact mutual accountability. The "primary focus," Tyler observes, is on bringing to account "responsible people" (Tyler and Thorisdottir 2003: 361) Tort claimants "are primarily interested in receiving an apology and restoring social order and respect." "[T]he key issue on people's minds [is] moral accountability." Where an individual has been negligently injured, compensation is generally "a poor substitute for . . . accountability" (Tyler and Thorisdottir 2003: 361). It is important, moreover, that accountability come

20 This account of tort remedy fits an account of a tort suit as a second-personal claim, of the sort Gideon Yaffe has spelled out. "It is a fact, and a non-obvious fact, that the question before the court in any negligence case is whether or not to make successful the plaintiff 's act of second-personal address of a second-personal reason" (Yaffe 2008: 959). In deciding for the plaintiff, the court in any civil case is acting on behalf of the plaintiff, enacting her request for damages. In this sense, when the court decides for the plaintiff, the plaintiff successfully conveys to the defendant, "you had a reason to take a precaution that would have prevented my injuries"—one whose validity depends on presupposed authority and accountability relationships between

persons. 21 Waldron finds this idea in Lon Fuller's notion the law has an "inner morality" demanding that it be general, public, prospective, intelligible, consistent, practicable, stable, and congruent (Fuller 1964). Every departure from these principles is "an affront to man's dignity as a responsible agent," because subjecting human conduct to rules involves a commitment to the view that persons are "responsible agent[s], capable of understanding and following rules" (Fuller 1964: 162). Waldron argues that particular aspects of legal procedure, not just form, for example, courts, hearings and arguments, are indispensable to the law's respect for the freedom and dignity of each person (Waldron 2010b: 20–2). 22 This fits also with Elizabeth Anderson's views in Anderson 1999 and elsewhere.

<span id="page-216-0"></span>through fair procedures. Studies of decision acceptance suggest that while both outcome and procedural fairness matter, procedural justice usually matters more (Tyler 2003). People are more likely to accept unfavorable outcomes when they result from procedures they regard as fair (Tyler 2006).

What makes a procedure fair according to litigants?23 First, having a voice or participating in the process (Tyler and Thorisdottir 2003: 380–1). Second, the perceived neutrality and lack of bias of authorized deciders (Tyler 2003: 298; Tyler and Thorisdottir 2003: 381). Judicial openness and explanation of the basis for decisions also bolster perceived fairness, as does the quality of interpersonal treatment by authorities. Acknowledgment of litigants' rights increases their sense that they have been treated with respect and dignity (Tyler and Thorisdottir 2003: 381).

In our view, both remedy and process in the law of torts enact the parties' mutual accountability to one another. We conclude, therefore, that civil recourse theory is best elaborated in these terms. What is at issue is not simply an individual authority that victims have to act against their victimizers, but an authority to hold tortfeasors accountable that victim and tortfeasor share reciprocally or mutually.24
